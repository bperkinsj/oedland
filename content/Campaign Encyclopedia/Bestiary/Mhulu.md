# Mhulu

_Translator's note: This is a foundational story of the Halamu, detailing both their arrival in this land and the forging of their relationship with the mhulus, or as we know them, the brachiosaurus. Veracity of the story is in question, though its timeline aligns with other origin stories shared by tribes across [[Oedland]]._

Many eons ago, when the world was young, the [[Halamu]] lived in a land of towering trees. These trees were so immense that all creatures could grow taller beneath their boughs, and many did, so that even creatures as tiny as a mosquito grew to impressive size. Some humans did as well, and those we call the Jitu, but that is a story for another time. Those who did not grow tall were the Halamu. They could not live on the ground, for the creatures that now lived there were so vast that they could step on a person and not even notice them, and so they made a home for themselves in the trees, where great leaf-eaters could not tread on them and great predators could not hunt them. They wove their homes out of branches like great birds' nests and learned how to navigate up and down the trunks. They learned how to make ropes to pull things up, how to use magic to soften their falls, and how to preserve foods that could only be cooked on the ground. As they grew older, they passed this knowledge on to their children, and soon they could not remember what it was like to live on the ground.

Because the world was young, the two moons, Tila and Nyuwe,
