1/3 of the devil army is headed towards [[Echetmol]] w/ both airships. 2/3 are headed towards the northeast.
There are around 3,000 [[Aatma Log]] in total.
[[Jeremiah Carver]] is above [[Tim]] in the hierarchy.
The party reached out to Tim and learned from him that the devils are converting plants to something they can eat.

```ad-note
Tim's response to the party
_Was wondering when I'd hear from you, I admit I am languishing in this new role, Jeramiah Carver was somehow given a position of superiority over me. And I'll spare you the details but he was not happy about his role in our escapades back in Ironrut. I don't understand why, I made the man money after all. Broke up his routine a bit, tried to teach him to shoot even. Mephiston bores me, smoke and brimstone is overdone by SEVERAL extra planar entities. Not my style! Tentacles and eldritch are in, wings and horns right out. Just so boring. I'll admit this gig has good killing. I'm not sure my contract even allows me to tell you this but lets push on its confines a bit? Haha shall we see what happens? There's always ways 'round these. The devils are feeding the plants to large processors/vats and are then spit out as what look like some form of cracker or hard tack. The devils cannot consume the plants. There are supplies in the form of a variety of twisted livestock and what may be grains or vegetables, but they are desiccated and one can presume not very nutritious. I know for a fact the devils are traveling northeasterdly to get more plant matter to convert for their...livestock, if you could call the monstrosities they breed that. Not sure yet but you may be meat for the grinder as well, but that's speculation on my part. P.s. You've done well for yourself Dawn, always knew you would. Again my apologies. Tell Blondie I regret nothing._

[[Dawn]] managed to get [[Dehan√§wis]]'s support in exchange for promising that no one would worship [[Glashnok]] in the end. She also pledged to support Dehanawis in whatever happened with the [[Kyrie Emprenacht]].
The party advises the tribes to begin moving north into the mountains.
Night passes, bringing them to 309-07-20.
The next day, the party decides to go on [[Blondie]]s beast hunt.
Name of guy helping Blondie with his hunt is [[Wattan]]. He advised them to hunt a [hooktongue hydra](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=2243).
