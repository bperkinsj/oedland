Fought [[ice croc]] momma and babies.

[[Tim]]â€™s journal started smoking as they were resting in the caverns. [[Dawn]] opened to find an apology from Tim a sentence long. They discussed the journal and what [[Cornelius Shiner|Cornelius]] wanted.

Made it to the Boshkonyi and spoke with 

[[Ysobel]] is teaching [[Sprout]] the Healing Plaster cantrip. [[Baem]] revealed some stuff about how the gods fractured. Said there had been 3 people who had been cursed like Dawn.

They spoke to [[Boshet]] and she gave Dawn the vision of an active [[Kuzorik]], [[Serech Val Korta|Serech]] being hunted down by devils, and a caravan of Serech headed northwards.

Dawn asked them to travel with her to fight the devils.

Boshet teleported all of them to the desert. Gave her the [[Cloak of Starlight]].
