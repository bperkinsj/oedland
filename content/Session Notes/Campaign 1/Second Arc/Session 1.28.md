## Julin 14th (309-07-14)
After [[The Great Gathering]], the party finds [[Yuzhuf]] snging with the [[Serech Val Korta]].
As everyone heads back to their tents, [[Dehanäwis]] confronts [[Dawn]] about [[Amandalynn]]. She asks Dawn if she trusts Amandalynn and [[Glashnok]], to which Dawn was unable to say yes. Dehanäwis tells Dawn she does not trust her and leaves.

## Julin 15th (309-07-15)
Yuzhuf thinks the [[Aegis Apotropaic]] has nullified the magic of the [[Formless Ones]] on the continent. 
 - Angus thinks the [[Kyrie Emprenacht]] tampered with the gods to let the devils invade so the Emprenacht could "save" them.
Dawn asks [[Hawk Who Touches the Heavens|Hawk]] to seek out [[Osiris]].
With [[Chaleha Sadevarra]], the party travels back into the [[Valley of Souls]]. They trek 8 hours through the jungle and find themselves on a cliff's edge. The path they took was carved into the side of the cliff and brought them to the [[Jikigo Sawon#Front Entrance|Jikigo Sawon's front entrance]]. Following the rules in the [[Tegseuteu]], Chaleha spoke the passphrase, but nothing happened. Blondie pushed against the door and found it was turned to ash that crumbled away at his touch. Within the antechamber, the party encountered a [gogiteth](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=237) and narrowly managed to slay it before it carried [[Flint]] away.
Yuzhuf took some of the plants and fungi and put them into opposing faces of a tin to see what would happen when they met.
A [kizidhar](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=2681) appeared and spoke to them.
