Name of [[Aatma Log]] man is Nakaab. He said they are guardians of a secret even he does not know.
They decided to bypass Pent San.

The Aatma Log gave the members of the caravan cold iron charms to keep the denizens of the [[Valley of Souls]] away. They traveled to a spirit village that bordered the [[River of Souls]]. They saw a great stream of spirits emerging from the river and traveling along a white cobblestone path far off into the distance. This path is in a channel next to the village, with a bridge crossing over it marking the end of the village. Across this bridge is a teleportation circle, a concave oval in the ground several hundred feet long and about 70 feet wide. There are multiple standing stones encircling this oval. As the caravan was about to teleport between the realms, [[Ysobel]] saw her sister in the stream of souls and broke out of the ring, attracting a large number of denizens who the party had to fight off. [[Dawn]] attempted to attack Ysobel's sister, not knowing who she was, but Ysobel absorbed the damage. The last thing the party saw before they teleported back to [[Echetmol]] was Ysobel talking to her sister.
When they arrived at the Great Gathering, they saw [[Lorath Nahr]] was in the camp.
