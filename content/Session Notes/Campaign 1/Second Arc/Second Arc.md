Having freed themselves of the Invidiak's curse, the party, Dragaroo Fodder, agrees to assist the rebels in robbing a train full of military supplies for the Emprenacht. With Cornelius Shiner's ultimatum to Amandalynn concerning Sprout looming over her head, the party conspires to fake Sprout's death and flees with her into the mountains, where Dawn hopes to find answers concerning her curse. And answers she does find, but more than she would have ever wanted, for Boshet also reveals to her the events that had transpired only a few days before their meeting - the eruption of Kuzorik, the destruction of her home, and the flight of the last of her people. Desperate, the party agrees to Boshet's teleporting them to the last surviving caravan and so help the last of Dawn's people make their way northward, fighting off devils the entire way.
The party stumbles into the [[Valley of Souls]] and decides to use it as a shortcut to the Great Gathering. At the Great Gathering, they learn of the fate of Verdorben from Lorath Nahr, debate their next steps with the tribes, and join together under the might of Glashnok (and Amandalynn in his stead). Their path decided, Dragaroo Fodder agree to help open the Jikigo Sawon for the first time in untold millenia. In doing so, they find a vault whose guardian has gone to war with itself and old allies locked in eternal slumber.
