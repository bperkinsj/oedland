There are a group of people travelling with [[Doleth Ewalago]].
3 days travel to the ruins.
[[Amandalynn]] is trying to leverage [[Dawn]] into protecting [[Glashnok]]. Dawn has promised to protect Glashnok if someone tries to kill Glashnok, but no more than that.
For reference, one mile in the Valley of Souls is roughly equal to 14 in the mortal realm (but this can change).
The party decides to go after Doleth instead of going to the [[Illithid Ruins]]. [[Hejawakanoh|Clever Sora]] greatly approves. [[Dehan√§wis]] also approves.
The party flies through the [[Valley of Souls]] to [[Ttep]]. It takes them three days. They arrive on 304-07-25.
[[Heshi]] is 140 miles to the west of Ttep.
[[Flint]] took a sample of decaying stuff from where Ttep died.
They go to a nearby village to ask about things, but the village was unaware of anything.
They go to Heshi. [[Yuzhuf]] pledged himself to defend Heshi. Heshi blessed his blade with a relic gift.

### Hero Points Awarded
1 Fate point for everyone (except Blondie).
1 persona point for Yuzhuf.
