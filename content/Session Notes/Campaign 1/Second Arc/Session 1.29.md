The party speaks to [[Jikigo Sawon#Mother|Mother Life]]  and agree to help her defeat [[Jikigo Sawon#Mother|Mother Death]]. She took the [[Aatma Log]] warriors hostage as leverage. They went towards Mother Death's side and had to fight a giant frog-like creature and a few fungi. They convinced a [Hyphae Tyrant](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=2602) to bring them to Mother Death. They convinced Mother Death to deceive Mother Life by pretending the party had killed her and allowing the plants to make progress against the fungi front. This successfully drew Mother Life to the central chamber, where Mother Death ambushes her.
