Travel 20 hours over 2 days to get back to the portal. Brings them to 309-07-18.
The vanguard of the devils is a week away from the caravan.
Resources of the native:
100 brachiosaurus
250 triceratops
200 pterodactyl riders
150 mushroom ents
50,000 mushroom warriors
300,000 natives

Devils:
2 airships
500 skiffs
50 sand barges

Pterodactyl riders sent out in pairs.
Devils are moving toward the closest source of organic matter. They have drained the oases and torn up plants.
Party plans to spy on devils at an oasis. They will use pterodactyls to get there.
[[Amandalynn]] tried to give the child some of the healing gel but she coughed it up (nat 1 on Fortitude lol). Amandalynn said the child would be healed.
Another man approached her with a festering wound on his hand. She successfully puts the gel on the man's hand. 
[[Niswe ono Mhulu]] told [[Dawn]] she needs to deal with [[Dehan√§wis]].
That night, they decided to scout out the oasis.
They saw a [Velstrac Interlocuter](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=851) ordering around some [[barbazu]]s to cut down trees.
The players decided to ask 4 leshies to infiltrate one of the devil patrols.
Got back to camp the next afternoon, 309-07-19.
