The party spoke to [[Lorath Nahr]]. He told them of [[The Desolation of Verdorben]] and how he traveled westward with the [[Red Otter Tribe]]. 

## The next two weeks (309-06-28 to 309-07-12)
Blondie talked to a man about [[beast guns]]. He needs to gain their respect in order to learn how to make one.
Amandalynn began to sow rumors of Glashnok.

## [[The Great Gathering]]

### [[The Great Gathering#Day One]] (309-07-13)
They said the prayer to the gods and then each of the tribes performed their ceremony. These took the entire day. The last tribe to perform were the [[Serech Val Korta|Serech]]. They beat a slow, persistent rhythm on their [[Nektala]]-hide drums that the rest of the tribes joined in on. They kept up this beat for the entire night.

### [[The Great Gathering#Day Two]] (309-07-14)
The representatives of the tribes gathered at the top of [[Echetmol]] and imbibed a caffeinated drink. [[Niswe ono Mhulu]] argued that he should be the one to lead the tribes into battle. [[Dehanäwis]] argued that the tribes should attack the weaker foe, the Emprenacht, first, which Dawn vehemently disagreed with. Dehanäwis misstepped and made light of the destruction of the Serech, which rapidly turned the rest of the representatives against her. Doleth and [[Hejawakanoh|Clever Sora]] argued whether they should follow or abandon the [[Formless Ones]]. [[Amandalynn]], sensing an opportunity, invoked the power of [[Glashnok]]. Thrusting her [[nail file dagger]] into the air, it burst alight with divine power as Glashnok's voice boomed out, promising salvation and victory if they follow him and his prophet, Amandalynn. Dozens of mushroom ents and hundreds of fungal leshies, an army of Glashnok's disciples, sprouted around Echetmol. Glashnok also granted everyone present telepathy. The tribes agreed to follow Glashnok and Amandalynn, although their loyalty is dubious and bound to be tested.
[[Doleth Ewalago|Doleth's]] allegiance with [[Nesset]] was exposed. Nesset fled and Doleth was exiled.
[[Chaleha Sadevarra]] told the party of the "allies" promised in the [[Jikigo Sawon]]. 
The party asked [[Hawk Who Touches the Heavens|Hawk]] to send messengers to tribes who lived close to the gods and see if they could find any black boxes similar to the [[Aegis Apotropaic]].
