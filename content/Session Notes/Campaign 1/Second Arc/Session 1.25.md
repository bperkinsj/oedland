The party tried to interrogate the [[barbazu]] but it doesn't speak common. 
They came across a patch of the [[Valley of Souls]]. 
Marynn asked if the trees looked like constellations from above. I think they do.
[[Yuzhuf]] went to the edge of the forest following the sound of water but saw only the desert. When he stepped onto the sand the sound stopped. When [[Blondie]] went up into the trees he saw a monkey with 4 arms and one eye for a face.
[[Ysobel]] ate the fruit and it tasted like mousse.
Blondie tastes stew. [[Dawn]] tastes [[Nektala]] blood. [[Amandalynn]] tastes fresh berries and soup.
There was a hummingbird that left an after-image as it flew past. Flint stuck his hands into the [[River of Souls]] and aged 5 years. They saw a current of some white amorphous shapes below the water when they threw their fire in. The fire stayed lit but the torch disintegrated. When they formed dancing lights below the surface, Dawn felt like she was pulling some great weight and had to let go.
Ysobel heard her sister's voice and followed it to the edge of a patch of the Valley.
Ysobel gave [[Sprout]] some biking goggles.

[[Eli Wallach|Eli]] came to give his proposition. Everyone refused. He tried to show off that he was fire immune. [[Flint]] exploded Huge right next to him, dealing acid damage and humiliating him (he will remember that).

Dawn and Flint while scouting outside the Valley patch got stuck when the sun came up and the forest moved back into the Valley..
During the day of the 29th, the caravan is stuck in the Valley of Souls.
A few bubble-like creatures with eyes (known as [[obbles]] found them, and one of them (who Amandalynn named [[Ronathan]]) led them back to its creator, [[The Keeper]]. He looks like the Lorax with a mushroom cap. He took them into his house. He referred to them as "one-facers", whereas he is a spirit and the [[Aatma Log]] are the "in-betweeners". He explained the Valley of Souls to them.  He made Ronathan last longer with magic. The Keeper studied forestry.
