Flower - raspy voice, kind of low. Wrestler's physique.
Sand - High, wiry girl. very thin.

[[Ysobel]] healed the lame [[Nektala]].

First two days: nothing happened (Jos 25th and 26th).


On 3rd day (Jos 27th), they see a devil vehicle (looks like a sand barge from Star Wars). Decide they need to set a trap for it when it returns.
They get to the oasis and set up a trap there.
Vehicle returns 18 hours later with a [[levaloch]] and six [[barbazu|barbazus]]. They disable the vehicle and kill the devils, and [[Flint]] manages to repair it.
