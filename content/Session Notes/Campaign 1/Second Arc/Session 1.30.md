[[Flint]] died in battle while trying to merge [[Mother (Guardian)#Mother Life|Mother Life]] with [[Mother (Guardian)#Mother Death|Mother Death]]. 
[[Dawn]], with [[Yuzhuf]]'s help, successfully merged the two and healed Mother. In so doing, she saw memories of the people who helped make Mother, one of whom wore a cloak of starlight much like the one she has.
