Starts on Jos 10th.

[[Ardbert]] agreed to help the rebellion.

[[Flint]] is a nondescript elderly man with a bunch of gadgets and a large suitcase.

[[Yuzhuf]] joined the party as well. 

They rode horses to [[Flatwood]]. Plan for getting [[Sprout]] out is formed.

Jos 11th.

They faked Sprout’s death. [[Dawn]] made one of the guards think he was going to die if he went outside. [[Amandalynn]] brought Sprout out and then [[Ysobel]] cast fireball right next to the entrance on a few pieces of cactus they had collected, scaring the guards. Amandalynn went in, told them that, and then went upstairs and took some of Sprout’s stuff.

Sprout was very distraught upon learning that she would have to vanish.

[[Glashnok (Deity)]] spoke to Amandalynn for the first time that night. He asked her to be his prophet.

They set out following the river.

Jos 12th. They arrive in [[Delbarton]]. Small logging town. They buy some winter clothes. Stay the night nearby.

Jos 13th. Continue further northwest. Reach the southernmost bend of the river (northwest of Delbarton).

Jos 14th.

Nalus – pangolin. The [[Alott]] people. River Rushing, a guide. Standing Bear, leader of the tribe. Kenes drink.

There is a soulwing in the [[Msitu]] tribe.

They had a feast with the tribe. Dawn, Ysobel, and Amandalynn told stories. Amandalynn just ranted about herself. Glashnok thinks she could have used that as a way to talk himself up.

Tribe learned their invisibility magic from displacer beasts.

[[Blondie]] is arachnophobic.
