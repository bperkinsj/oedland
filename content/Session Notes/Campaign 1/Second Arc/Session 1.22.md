Jos 16th.

River Rushing passed them off to Heron Patiently Waiting (who very clearly did not like Dawn).

[[Dawn]] doesn’t want to give up the positive aspects of her curse.

Arrived at [[Msitu]] tribe.

[[Flint]] is 60.

Amandalynn told the story of the Great Winds. In the early days, fires rained down from the heavens. Everything burned down to a crisp. But the people who fled saw [[Glashnok (Deity)]]. The people bowed down to Glashnok. Glashnok flipped his crown up like an umbrella and brought rainfall. The rains caused mushrooms.

Amandalynn rolled a nat 20 to teach the Msitu about Glashnok. She was able to convince everyone to dance in a circle and shout Glashnok, but most people seemed more confused than inspired. One kid really bought into it.

Jos 17th.

They arrived at [[Serpent’s Head Rock]].

Jos 18th.

They found the stone whorl.

Jos 19th.

Met the [[Pisi Rumikana]] at end of the day. Dawn tells the story of how to become a warrior. The [[Serech Val Korta|Ashuk-Sin]] are tasked with climbing the great volcano.

Jos 20th.

They make it to the [[ancestor stones]].

Jos 21st.

They make it to the [[Great Horizon]]. There is an earthquake shortly afterwards that causes avalanches all around them, but they manage to hang on. The earthquake was caused by the eruption of[[ Kuzorik]].

Jos 22nd.

They saw ash falling in the morning.

The [[ice croc]] attacked the party at the end of the session. [[Yuzhuf]] is in front.
