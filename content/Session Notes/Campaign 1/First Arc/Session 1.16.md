```ad-read-aloud
As the train rolls eastward, the land slowly changes from sparse and arid to lush and verdant. Great forests of grand old maples and oaks dapple the tracks, brooks and streams babble beneath bridges, and rolling fields of grains shine their soft golden glow. You pass so closely by granite cliff faces that you can see every crack and crevice, like the wrinkles of smiling grandparents who recline across the landscape. Birds whirl among stalks or circle high above the foliage; cows laze contentedly, their chewing cud their foremost concern; squirrels break their cover as they leap from branch to branch. As the distance between you and Blueford widens, the signs of humanity increase, farms burgeoning into villages that bloom into towns. At the train stations, you see kids running to and fro, jumping to embrace their parents or uncles or sisters returned from their long trek; husbands and wives hold each other, letters clutched in their hands; drifters pause as they depart their carriage to take in the sight of their new, temporary home. With each stop, the crowds grow, a swelling wave of humanity that carries you further and further east, cresting higher and higher, until finally you top a hill and see its peak: Verdorben.
Verdorben. A sprawling, chaotic tangle of buildings and streets, a spiderweb gone haywire, a riotous parade dominated by two structures: the Grand Cathedral and the Áit Foghlama. The Grand Cathedral is a circular, gold-domed structure buttressed by ruby-red colonnades and ringed by towering statues of angelic figures. The Áit Foghlama is a hollow pentagon, a semi-continuous line of buildings broken up by columns through which you can see a forested lawn, its architecture stately and inspiring. 
Buildings squat wherever they can find purchase, leaning against each other for support, and whatever space is left between them is quickly populated by stands or carts overflowing with foodstuffs, or barrels stacked haphazardly, or trees that struggle to reassert themselves against humanity's indifference. On the outskirts the ground is still dirt, stamped flat by thousands of feet flowing over it, but even where the streets are cobbled it's an uneven, bumpy floor, so skewered in places you need sea legs to walk it. The buildings are mostly brick and mortar, austere Kyrien (read: Victorian) design, but bright clothes and pennants wave from clothes lines or atop roofs. Horses pulling carriages snort and buck as dogs dash between their legs, merrily defying death. People sing, laugh, and haggle; criers shout the daily news; and even the animals pitch in, oxen lowing, chickens clucking, pigs snorting, and geese honking.
