Stayed the night in [[Luck’s End]]. Traveled to [[Ironrut]] the next morning.

[[Gertrude Pflanze]] gave the party 100 gp and 260 store credit. Party took 5 lesser healing potions: store credit now 200.

[[Ysobel]] went to check on [[Jeremiah Carver]]. He was asleep on the ground. He’ll disappear in a few days.

They discussed [[Amandalynn]]’s portrait.

Charlie Hucker – old, wrinkled black dwarf. Has a respiratory issue from years of working in the mines. Told them of a leader by the name of [[Foxglove]]. The next day traveled to [[Blueford]].

[[Elijah T. McDaniels]] is running for re-election. He helped establish order by hiring a sheriff and setting laws for conduct in the town. Also mandated where rustlers could take their cattle.

Henry O’Brian lodged multiple complaints.

Miles Mason – Sheriff.

Elijah McDaniels family – Truth (wife), sons Isaac and Abel, daughter Phoebe.

Butch and Miles are unmarried.

Gordons, Buchanans, Clements, Perkings are all farmers around town.

Ysobel made a check to forge Elijah’s signature. She failed with an 18 against a DC of 20, so it looks fairly similar but doesn’t hold up to scrutiny.

Julian Reich is the paster of the Blueford Church. Baptism is an initiation. Either pour water over one head or get dunked into river. There may be complications with the baptism due to Amandalynn being cursed.

Amandalynn told him she had a vision of the [[God-Emperor (Deity)]] in an open field. She saw the God-Emperor rise in a golden sky and she ascended. She said she was born on the 9th of Sigis. Pastor Reich is going to write the bishop about her. At the baptism, the demon’s curse will be exorcised.

[[Dynachter Otto]] cured a city of plague.

[[Friedrich I]] burned the city of [[Velsvitch]] to the ground after the [[Duke Heinz Castrapp]] refused his invitation into the [[Kyrie Emprenacht|Emprenacht]].

If Amandalynn baptism goes well, her nail file will become a relic.

What is Cornelius’ issue with Elijah McDaniels? They ended in the afternoon at the saloon. Amandalynn convinced the bartender to vote for her.
