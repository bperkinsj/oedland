The players are cursed upon investigating the Temple of Osiris. They learn that if they die while under this curse, their souls will be absorbed by the Invidiak. Desperate to rid themselves of the curse, they engage in seedy deals with sordid figures ranging from the powerful new barons of the land to a devil of unknown motive.  Eventually, after many failures and much research, the party manages to trap the shadow demon and slay it, freeing themselves.
