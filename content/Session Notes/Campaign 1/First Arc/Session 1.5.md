First hour or so was spent shopping.
Party went to the [[Church of St. Martin de Porres]]. Came in while choir was singing. [[Darwin]] added wonderfully to it. [[Father Imani]] gave a sermon afterwards. After mass, party asked him about the [[Invidiak |demon]]. He took the tainted water from them and poured it onto the bible. A [[Shadow]] sprang from it. They fought it (Father Imani did most of the damage to it). Afterwards, they asked him some questions about [[St. Martin de Porres]] and [[Shtegaltism]].
