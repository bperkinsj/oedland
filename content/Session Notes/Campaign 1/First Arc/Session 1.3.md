[[Amad]] informed the party of her people's history, detailing how they abandoned their given duty to protect the [[Temple of Osiris]]. They had beseeched their gods, the [[Formless Ones]], for aid or advice as they were time and time again bloodied by attacking [[demons]], [[devils]], and [[aberrations]], but their pleas for help fell on deaf ears. The last time they were assaulted was when [[Eikon]] was struck down. [[Doleth Ewalago]], upon learning of this, grew incensed and left the abode.
The players, especially [[Darwin]], freaked out about the curse tainting the temple. They asked about the last demon to attack the temple. 
Eikon really tried to interrogate [[Stacey]] but was unsuccessful. They decided they needed water from the temple for a priest to look at. 
Eikon intimidated Stacey into spilling the beans in front of a crowd gathered around Doleth. Eikon felt Stacey was a failure (GM Note: Eikon's kind of a dick). People in the crowd called Eikon and Darwin Yawami. Eikon remembered enough of the language to know it means Redeemer.
[[Ysobel]] was interested in the farming techniques of the Tche sh√§. She wants to put plants on the side of her horse.
[[Sprout]] said people at the branch of the [[Academi Pentacoli]] in [[Verdorben]] here might know.
Ysobel made a pretty workable scarecrow effigy from a block of wood. She also bought a block of salt.
They did not get paid on that night, Tuesday night.
Next day, as they were ranging out in the countryside, they came upon a [[flame drake]]. The flame drake beat the shit out of them and I recommended they look into adjusting their characters some.
Alex decided to sacrifice Stacey and make Eikon a cleric after learning how summoners work.
