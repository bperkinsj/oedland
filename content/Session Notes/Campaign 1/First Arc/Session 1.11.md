Owner of the house said they would hear about this. He’s going to talk to the captain of the guard.

The party tracked the [[nightgaunt]] and found [[Ysobel]] (the nightgaunt got scared off). [[Tisiphone|Tiff]] told them they did terrible and then suggested some equipment to get.

They bought a ghost rune from [[Blueford|Bart’s Wondrous Goods]].

Got on the train w/ [[Cornelius Shiner|Cornelius]]. [[Tim]] and [[Blondie]] talked about their mutual goals with Eli Wallach. Blondie wouldn’t agree to work with Tim unless [[Eli Wallach|Eli]] came after him. [[Ardbert]] and Ysobel went to speak to Madeline. Told to go find Charlie Hucker. Tim learned from a failed Recall Knowledge check that Eli was plotting revenge, but that cowboys play by a very strict code, so Eli will make it a public spectacle.

Took Cornelius to the cave. [[Celia Emerickson|Celia]] took sketches and notes. Cornelius just touched it.

Elan (native guard) told [[Dawn]] that [[Doleth Ewalago]] had taken most of the hunting-age men and went to find the gods.

When they left the cave Elan was gone. Dawn and Tim tracked a set of footprints that intersect with another set, there’s a scuffle, and then one set of footprints leaves. They find another, similar thing around the hill. The footprints then took a parallel path back to [[Luck’s End]].

Eli knows from a painting that Tim basically scammed his degree.

Tim grew upon a backwater Britain-like isle that is mostly known for whaling and fishing, but it does have a good university. Tim scammed his thesis in essence. His staff doesn’t really work – it only successfully cast dimension door under his control once and mostly cause his prof helped. Tim fell through a portal while arguing with a magic painting and fell unconscious. Eli learned from the painting that Tim is a fraud and so has used that knowledge to threaten Tim’s reputation. Eli has the painting locked away in[[ Billy Boyd]]’s estate.
