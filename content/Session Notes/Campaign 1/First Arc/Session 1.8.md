[[Tim]] hit [[Jeremiah Carver]] in the leg on Tuesday.
[[Amandalynn]] disappeared so her family wouldn't put any responsibility on her.
On Wednesday in the morning Tim hit Jeremiah in the gut.
The party agreed to two terms with [[Tisiphone|Tiff]]: that she could do what she wanted with the person possessed by the demon & that Amandalynn would accept the offer given to her. [[Dawn]] could not agree to Tiff's request to not return to her family.
They went to speak with [[Pastor Ebenezer Ekel|Father Ekel]].
Ekel gave Amandalynn a blessed item (crown symbol). 
Tim summoned Tiff. She implied they both work for Mephistopheles and that he is who to get information from. [[Blueford]] is 80 km away from [[Ironrut]].
Left Ironrut on mid-Thursday.
Arrived in Blueford and were summoned to [[Cornelius Shiner]]'s manor to speak. They agreed to 75 gp per person to escort him to the [[Temple of Osiris]]. Amandalynn agreed to his offer and now has two tasks: Humiliating [[Elijah T. McDaniels]] and (eventually) eliminating [[Sprout]]. 
[[Ysobel]] sniffed out that Tiff is a [[devil]].
Taking the train costs the same as sailing (Tim did not pay).
Amandalynn is maybe not as intelligent as Cornelius (and I) thought. Neera plays her on the very edge of obliviousness. Cornelius may get rid of her after a time. But, most of all, she reminds him of his daughter (appearance-wise). He sees "her ghost in your features".
