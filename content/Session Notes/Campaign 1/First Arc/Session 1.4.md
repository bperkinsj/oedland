This time, when they fought the [[flame drake]], they managed to beat it. [[Amandalynn]] cut out one of its eyes and [[Blondie]] got the killing blow on it. They found a vein of gold in the drake's lair. They brought the dragon's body back with them (with the help of [[Darwin]] and [[Ysobel]]'s horse) to Luck's End and got 75 gp each from Crasp (25 for drake, 50 for finding the gold vein). The players took the drake into [[Ironrut]] the next day. Amandalynn asked for information from Ishira, the bartender of the saloon The Lucky Shot, and got shut down pretty hard. [[Eikon]] inquired after armor from Darth, a dwarven shield smith, and Sheila, a human armorsmith.
They took the drake to [[Gertrude Pflanze]], the gnomish witch/apothecarist/herbalist, who gave them store credit in exchange for letting her harvest the drake. She gave the party 180 gp store credit (I might have to revise that). Gertrude then advised the party to seek out [[Father Imani]] (preferably) or [[Pastor Ebenezer Ekel]].
