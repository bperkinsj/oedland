In the second room, the party came across [[Eikon]] and [[Stacey]]. Stacey was forced to reveal what she knew, but begged them not to tell Eikon. She described the demon that attacked them as "big, black, with crimson eyes and draconic wings." The party decided to walk through the water rather than cross over the rune traps. They drank from the bowls in the middle of the water and regained hit points (the bowls had inscriptions roughly translating to "Drink this and be rejuvenated). [[Dawn]], [[Darwin]], and [[Amandalynn]] failed their saves against the demon's curse. In the next room, they found the orb and some treasure (I forget what. I think one cold-iron weapon and two other weapons). [[Ysobel]] found a secret door that led out to a cliffside after a little bit of walking. The door works by pressing your hand into a particular section, after which it dissolves. There were old, eroded stairs on the cliff wall leading up to the cave in the canyon wall, indicating disuse and abandonment. They were too eroded to climb down. The players spotted what looked like game tracks on the ground around the canyon. Dawn decided to send a letter back home. The next day, they decided to follow the game trail and ran into members of the [[Tche shä]]. After revealing they had discovered the [[Temple of Osiris |Womb of Osiris]], they were escorted back to the Tche shä village and met with the leader of the tribe, titled the [[Amad]]. She probed Dawn's mind to determine if she was trustworthy, then the session ended with her saying "Let me tell you the story of my people's shame."
