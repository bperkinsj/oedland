They spoke to [[Jeremiah Carver]] and figured out that [[Billy Boyd]] drove him into debt. "My beautiful land... rolling acres..."
They went to Billy Boyd. [[Ysobel]] offered the party as guides, the exact thing she needed to say to get into the camp. When they met Billy Boyd, he was with [[Inquisitor Ermitt]]. She took special note of [[Eikon]] as she left the tent ("her nose flared, as if drinking in his scent").
Billy hired them at 30 gp/each with a 100 gp bonus if they found and killed the [[dragaroo]].
Obviously, [[Darwin]] was ecstatic to learn there was someone else who thought it was real.
Billy called in [[Eli Wallach|Eli]] to show the players where they could sleep. He took note of Eli's reaction upon seeing [[Blondie]].
Blondie decided to stay at an inn in town to avoid Eli.
[[Sprout]] said goodbye to [[Dawn]], saying she learned a lot from her.
The next day, the players started guiding the expedition. Blondie bought a map of the surrounding area to identify possible watering holes. He also bought some licorice, which he offered to Eli as an appeasement. Eli took the licorice, took a bite, and when Blondie asked, "No hard feelings?", he spit it out and replied "No hard feelings."
The players found one watering hole that day, but no kangaroos.
The next day, the players went west and found kangaroo tracks. 
Darwin talked to some people that night around a campfire, including Tom and George. One of them (Tom) said he saw "a woman with blonde hair, red eyes, & red wings standing on a cliff." She had a "whip of her own hair". One woman has an aunt in the north of [[Verdorben]], in the swamps. She's a shoulderwoman/shaman.
Next day, followed tracks of a large kangaroo mob northwards. Found two dead [[terrorbirds]]. At the end of the day, as the sun was setting, they came upon the dragaroo.
Billy Boyd got the killing blow with a nat 20. At that point, the mother dragaroo showed up, killing Tom and George, and everyone fled for their lives.
