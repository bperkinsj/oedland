[[Amandalynn]] told the group [[Cornelius Shiner|Cornelius]] wants her to be mayor. [[Tim]] fully believes her.

Current year is 309. Inn in [[Blueford]] is Tack & Tallow.

[[Ardbert]]: Human, short hair, 30’s, looks pretty rugged, big sword on back, left eye is injured, scale mail, very muscular.

[[Ysobel]] has scarf and gloves on even in the heat. Marcus is the name of the slave trader. Tim breathed poison fog into Marcus’ mouth and accidentally killed him with Daze. He went invisible. Cast Command on the guard captain and pinned it on the guy yelling (truthfully) that it was Tim. Went invisible to sneak away.

The two slaves, a kitsune boy and a female Goloma, managed to escape. The kitsune gave Ardbert a coin that he told him could be used in the [[Valley of Souls]].

Captain of the guard questioned everyone, released the man blamed by Tim, and put out a 30 gp bounty for Tim.

Ysobel told Ardbert that [[Father Imani]] was hanged.

Tim bought 3 sets of clothes, a pitcher of orange paint and a brush.

They got a room at the Tack and Tallow for 3 sp for everyone except Ardbert (he already paid).

They cleared out the poltergeists in [[Iskaral Pust]]’s basement.

Tim works for [[Eli Wallach|Eli]], Eli asked Tim to follow group. Tim got pistol while killing somebody who was asking after Eli. Tim got staff for old university prof who was basically senile.
