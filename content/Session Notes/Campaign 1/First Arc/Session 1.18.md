Starts in midafternoon. [[Ysobel]] rolled well on the Mist Island and the coin. [[Reino de Avaria|Avarian]] explorer encountered group of Indigenous people with “skin the color of ash” who wear wooden masks. [[Valley of Souls]] is the Boshkonyi afterlife, but also of the Eshtawus.

[[Ardbert]] saw a catfolk, [[Guillermo Santisteban]], talking to the slaves. Told them to meet him at the [[Lamplight Falls]] if they wanted to help.

Went to Lamplight Falls. Ardbert chose to kill the informant, as [[Foxglove]] asked. [[Tim]] called himself Sethson Fisher.

Next day, [[Cornelius Shiner|Cornelius]] gives 150 gp per person to the party for [[Celia Emerickson|Celia]] coming back.

[[Amandalynn]] told Cornelius she has a grand plan in place to kill [[Sprout]]. Cornelius gave her a 1-week ultimatum.

Cornelius agreed to Tim’s request for employment. He asked Tim to protect an arcane item on the train.

Ardbert gets a note to go to the Desert Rose and ask for a bouquet of nightshade.

[[Ysobel]] can tell Amandalynn still wants to kill Sprout.

Past [[Hathaway]], they will rob the train. 20 minutes to next town after Hathaway. The [[Aegis Apotropaic|military item]] creates a zone devoid of primal magic.

Ice cream is 5 sp.

[[Eshtawus]] is the main tribe fighting the Avarians.

Tosden 26 is the day they talked to Prof Handel.

Need to tell them where Sprout is and layout/defense of train.

Ysobel and Amandalynn are going to be disguised for the train heist. They’re going to say they’re not available to defend the train so they can go find Sprout.
