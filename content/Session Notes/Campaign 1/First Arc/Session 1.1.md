Players started in [[Luck's end]]. Were informed by Crasp that finding a gold vein would net them 50 gp. Set out with Scruff as their guide. Ran into a pack of compsognathus. Discovered a cave that held a giant spider and some animated vines. Passageway in it entered into some sort of anterior chamber. A large mural on the wall depicting [[Osiris]] watering the world with the [[Seed of Osiris]], with plants sprouting up behind him and animals following after him. They cleared out the blockage in the passageway leading further into the temple, with [[Darwin]] rolling a natural 1 (which scraped part of the mural) followed by a natural 20 alongside the assistance of a horse summoned by [[Ysobel]]. After traveling down the tunnel, they found an small room filled with discarded debris and one intact urn. Upon poking open the urn, it released a noxious fume. They just walked into the tunnel to avoid it. The session ended there.
