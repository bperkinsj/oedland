Bought 6 sunrods.

Zoning regulation set up because somebody was trying to build a hotel for the cowboys.

Perky young woman owns the general store. Zipporah Rowan.

[[Billy Boyd]] owns a couple farms around [[Blueford]]. The bartender is not a huge fan of [[Elijah T. McDaniels|Elijah]] because he can’t build a second story for his inn.

Guy named Foster wanted to build the hotel.

The governor is in charge of giving out deeds and titles.

A lot of the settlers are illiterate.

Zoning laws prevent cattle from grazing where the grass is good.

They went to sleep.

37 generations ago, the gods left. This is wrong though – they left earlier.

Need to figure out: who does Cornelius’ magic for him?

Billy Boyd bought 3 farms 3 years ago.

[[Iskaral Pust|Iskaral]] told them that [[Cornelius Shiner|Cornelius]] is a very powerful man, possibly rivaling the [[God-Emperor (Deity)]] in pure power. But he doesn’t know what his goals are and keeps his distance. After learning Cornelius has an interest in Blueford, he decides to leave. Iskaral gave [[Tim]] a spell for the promise that Tim makes Elijah McDaniels and some of the townsfolk eat shit. Iskaral learned Cornelius is interested in the [[Seed of Osiris]]. Also learned that it’s nearby and asked if the party would take him to it.

[[Ardbert]] successfully forged posters for the other two candidates.

They end the night at Feiden with [[Dawn]] and Tim talking about Cornelius.

Iskaral fears Cornelius. Told the party he’s 600 years old.
