Heist happens on Jos 10th.

They go up and over the locomotive. [[Tim]] tried to teleport with black box, but [[Tisiphone|Tiff]] appeared at the last moment and blew his head off. Because Angus rolled a 1 on a d100, I decided his body and the [[Aegis Apotropaic|black box]] still successfully teleported to his library. Tim left his journal behind.
