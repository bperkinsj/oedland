[[Ysobel]] saw no flies circling around [[Briolette]].

[[Amandalynn]] told [[Cornelius Shiner|Cornelius]] that she had incriminating information on [[Butch Foley]].

[[Sprout]] says plants choose their names cause their plant names are pheromones they release. Some substances allow people to sense these pheromones.

They went back to the cave under the guise of hunting more monsters. They found that the footprints go back to the camp, both coming and leaving. They also found a spot where somebody looked to lie down and observe the entrance of the cave. Ysobel found a small damp spot of sand and tasted it. Found it was alcohol.

[[Blondie]] saw that [[Eli Wallach|Eli]]’s boots are los (?) and match the footprints. [[Tim]] pulled Eli’s stool over as he was about to drink. He got a good look at his bootprints, but Eli grabbed his wrist and saw Tim had the etching of a bootprint. He left after finishing his second drink. Ysobel won some money at poker with help from Amandalynn, but their cover almost got blown.

[[Celia Emerickson|Celia]] talked to Tim, Blondie, and [[Dawn]]. Said Blondie smelled bad (he now thinks he’s cursed). Asked Dawn about her tribe and if she could visit. Dawn said there’s a yearly gathering of tribes she could go to. Tim asked about Cornelius. She said he’s intelligent and works by his own code. Not a good or bad man.

Celia and two others disappeared. They followed Eli out into the desert. He tried to ambush them.

[[Invidiak|Demon]] vanished via dimension door. He winked at Tim before departing (just to freak Tim out). Eli told Ysobel he had nothing against her but told her about [[Billy Boyd]], implying he burned her family’s ranch down.

Eli told Tim that the painting was in a safe on Billy Boyd’s manor. Also told Tim and Blondie that he would come for them. [[Tisiphone|Tiff]] then bamphed out him out with the Fool tarot card.

Tiff told them to meet her at the temple location the next afternoon.
