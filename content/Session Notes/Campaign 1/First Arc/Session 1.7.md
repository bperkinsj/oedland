They got away from the [[dragaroo]] and lost 9 men in the process.
[[Blondie]] learned about [[beast guns]] from [[Billy Boyd]].
Kyle (random dude in camp) told them about [[Tisiphone]] (Tiff). [[Darwin]] was convinced she was real, saying that the dragaroo was proof she was real. They also heard about Urist and Hannah "Greenscales".
Next day, they met [[Tim]] at an abandoned farmhouse.
On a failed Recall Knowledge check, he learned that [[Invidiak|shadow demon]]s cannot be hurt unless w/ a ghost touch rune, & that they have cold resistance.
The next day, they got [[Jeremiah Carver]] to realize that Billy Boyd had conned him and declare vengeance. Tiff appeared in the Lucky Shot and offered to help them "Get supplies, track the demon, and kill it'. In return, she needed three promises: that [[Dawn]] not return to her tribe when requested, that Tiff get to choose what happens with the person possessed by the demon, and that [[Amandalynn]] accept the offer of partnership soon to be given to her. They agreed to meet with Tiff at the next dawn to decide.
They saw [[Father Imani]] hung by [[Inquisitor Ermitt]].
Tim bullied Jeremiah Carver into letting Tim shoot at him (a requirement of the devil-pact gun that Tim has) and also into assisting Tim in robbing nearby homes. Tim got 15 gp and a life-long enemy from that ordeal. 
They asked [[Gertrude Pflanze]] to make them some ghost runes. They retrieved some sun orchid dew, a principal component, and in return Gertrude waived the labor cost, bringing each rune down to their regular price.
There was a slight time skip where the players said goodbye to Darwin at the train station on Thursday. He ran off into the sunset, even though that was the wrong way to go. He now works for Billy Boyd.
