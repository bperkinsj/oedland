## Baem and Boshet
10,000 steps to ascend from the [[Boshkonyi]] to the glade where Baem is.
Glade is magical. It's near the summit of Boundary Peak. A moss-carpeted opening with a sheer drop on the chasm edge. Ferns and flowers seem to sparkle as if reflecting the stars above. 
[[Baem]] (pem) is a mix couatl. Elongates many consonants. Is snarky and sardonic.


To speak to Boshet, players must cross a chasm. Baem tells Dawn she must have faith and that "only in the dark can stars shine (or the path be seen)". 

(Nature Check) Boshet is a fungal colony riding on a web of sparkling silken strands. Speaks in a cryptic, distracted manner. Will only really appear lucid when speaking of Dawn's family.
Dawn was a mistake, a vessel that was not shaped to accept part of Boshet. Every time she tries to draw upon her powers, in essence fusing more with the fungus, her body rejects it even more.
Doleth spoke to Boshet. His "heart burned like the sun."

Boshet shows her a vision of Kuzorik

```ad-read-aloud
_Accompany with [Your Mother Is Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DFR41LS5A0), starting on the first instance of the word "flower"_

--------

A scene blossoms before you like a flower of onyx and ruby. Kuzorik has bloomed, and now its petals of red and black - lava flows against volcanic stone - unfurl from a churning crimson center. Thick smog wafts into the air like a cloud of pumiceous seeds scattered to the winds. They are mixed by updrafts and contorted by heat waves to blanket the view, until around you is as obscured as if you were peering through a dark cotton sheet. The sound carries to you as well - the grind of stone against stone, the deafening hiccups of scalding lava encountering pockets of moisture, the rumble of gases escaping the volcano's throat. It is a crusted scar that has cracked open and bleeds once more.

You peer desperately through the smoke, looking for a sign of something familiar. You search for the lines of crops studiously nurtured to retain moisture, the wells where water was drawn from deep within the earth. You search for the hollows amongst rocks where people dwelt at the peak of day. You search for the lines your young feet wore into the base of the volcano and the path you took to its summit. But there is nothing. Where once your tribe made its home, at the foot of this monstrosity, there is nothing left. Nothing but a layer of ash.
The vision shifts and you see a dozen people wandering across what was once a sea of bright sand, and is now a sea of darkened ash. They hold their cloaks tight to their faces and their hands across their eyes. Their mouths are covered in dampened cloth. Spears and bows dangle from their backs. A hunting party, caught unawares by the eruption and now stranded in the thickening gloom, searching for anything familiar, anybody they can find. At the back of their party, one of them screams and stumbles as a steel sword swings from the dust and hamstrings them. As they hit the ground, body contorting in shock, they are decapitated. In moments, the group is surrounded, and though they reach for their weapons and rally together, they are not prepared. Silvery weapons strike from all angles, on the ends of burnt-red, sinewy arms, and within seconds they are all dead. One of them reaches towards another in their last gasping breath, and their head is crushed beneath a calcified boot. Something is hunting them.

And then again, the vision moves, and you see a caravan of your people. The air is clear here, and the stars burn brilliantly above, but the desert is vitiligous, pockmarked by splotches of ash. Barely discernible, no more than dark smudges on the desert, several hundred people move in file alongside plodding lizards. What must amount to all of their worldly possessions are strung across the creatures' backs. They walk with their heads bowed and their shoulders bent. They walk as if they are beaten. They walk northwards.

Boshet gives her a Cloak of Elvenkind which is a relic seed with the Celestial and Cosmos aspects. It has the Heaven's Grace Minor Gift (https://2e.aonprd.com/Relics.aspx?Aspect=3) and gives resistance to fire damage. Also has the Hunter's Moon minor gift (You gain low light vision, this becomes darkvision at level 9.)

## Meeting with Stone
Stone That Weathers Storms.

A nonbinary, blind, diminutive human. Fully shaved head. Wears a lightly fitting silk robe (not unlike a kimono) that is dyed in bright purples and yellows. Very insightful, very sharp, has an uncanny ability to read others' emotions.

Key information to be relayed to players:
Another person came through and spoke to Boshet. He was full of anger and left quickly after speaking to the goddess.
