## Layout

### Front Entrance
```ad-read-aloud
Embedded within the slick, damp back wall of this cave is a circular doorway. Petrified, ashen wood inscribed with delicate filigree depicts a female elf, eyes closed in gentle repose and the world held tenderly in her embrace. Around her spiral vines and flowers, twisting amongst each other into waves of cords that thicken and thin, a surface that curls and loosens in waves.
...

As the door crumbles before you, shafts of light break into the room beyond, illuminating pieces of a grisly scene.
```

Passphrase to open the entrance:
"igos-eul jikineun ulideul-eun ttaega wassdago malhane" (We who guard this place say the time has come)
### Entry Area
Within are piles of bodies, speared through, torn apart, or crushed into fine bits. There are multitudes of creatures here: figures that appear to have been carved of wood, deformed creatures of flesh with heads that split apart into a gaping maw, a being whose skin and internal organs are almost entirely translucent. 

An injured, weakened gogiteth is lying in wait here. Once it has sustained ~100 points of damage, it will attempt to grab one of the Aatma log warriors and flee further inside.
