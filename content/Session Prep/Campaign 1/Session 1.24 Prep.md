The caravan is traveling to [[Echetmol]].
They are currently traveling at 20 km/day. If they cull the injured Nektala, they get up to 30.
118 people in the caravan, 40 Nektala. They consume 450 pounds of food per day and 400 liters of water. To simplify this, we'll say that 1 provision is equal to 90 lbs of food and 80 liters of water, so you need 5 provisions per day. At the moment, they have 25 provisions.
If they cull the injured Nektala from the herd, they lose 7 provisions.
The nearest oasis is 80 km away.
