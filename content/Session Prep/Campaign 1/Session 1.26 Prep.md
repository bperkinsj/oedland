A [blood painter](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1081_) in a lair that is spiral in shape, not unlike the Guggenheim (although with only 1 spiral). The blood painter has 3 [dandasuka](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=344) minions (one who leads the party to its lair disguised as The Keeper), one pet [shimmernewt](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=2081), and one pet [zuipnyrn](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=515). At the entrance to this spiral lair is a wooden platform that the Blood Painter can collapse at will.
If anyone chooses to observe the art work alongside the Blood Painter, they must make a Will save.

```ad-check
### DC 28 Will Save
*Success* The target is unaffected
*Failure* The target is enthralled by the artwork and finds themselves agreeing with much of what the Blood Painter says. If the Blood Painter makes a comment along the lines of using the target for an art piece, the target will be oblivious to the implication. The target can be shaken out of this stupor 
*Critical Failure* As failure, but instead if the Blood Painter makes a comment about using the target for an art piece, the character vehemently agrees and tries to convince others to go along with it.
```

```ad-quote
## The Blood Painter
"Ah! Splended timing. I had been recently meditating on mortal art. Come, browse my collection. I have curated one of notable renown."
"It is the trials and tribulations of mortals that most captures my attention. Your faiths, your follies, your essential desire to be captured in the fabric of the world so that you may look upon yourself and know you are seen."
_To [[Yuzhuf]]_: "This one is prime example. Does he not fear the recriminations of his fellow man? Does the mask adorning his face not reflect that which he wishes others to see? Yet it more often reveals the shame he would remain hidden."

```

# The Village

### Depiction

```ad-read-aloud
The village is a spacious, bright place of graceful wooden buildings topped by slanted roofs whose brick shingles soar gracefully beyond the edges of the gables. Flowers of innumerable form - marigold, cockscomb, chrysanthemum, gladiola - burst from every window, and honeysuckle and orchids intertwine beneath the eaves. The cobbled streets are packed with carts, stalls, vendors, and customers, whose appearances are as varied and bizarre as the items on offer. You see star-shaped nuts, fruits that when opened reveal a spiraling central flesh, candies that ooze a syrup that constantly flows over its surface. Diminutive plates with spindly legs move atop the stall counters, picking up items and proffering them to onlookers until they are relieved of their cargo. A rotund creature with leathery skin and a flaccid trunk for a nose lounges and looks on idly as small globs atop a heated pan sizzle, pop, and leap several feet into the air, every so often scooping them up to be deposited into a metal bowl and a fresh batch placed upon the pan.

### Creatures of the Village

The indigenous people give several people cold iron tokens and tell them to keep them displayed at all times. They also put them on the outer edges of the group. 
# The Portal
Just before they go through the portal, Ysobel sees her sister in the crowd. 
This encounter is optional depending on how much time goes by in the Blood Painter's lair.

The portal is a circular depression with seven standing stones ringing it, each of a deep blue stone that sparkles faintly in the light.

```ad-check
DC 30 Arcana check can tell that several of the standing stones are cracked enough to partly break the inscriptions carved into them.
