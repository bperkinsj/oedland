## The [[Custodian]]

The most common to surface are Custodian Logic, Custodian Empathy, Custodian Creativity, Custodian Apathy, and Custodian Frustration. Custodian Fury would surface more frequently but is kept in check by the other personalities. 

````ad-read-aloud
Custodian Frustration: "The key has proven frustratingly elusive."
Custodian Logic: "Although we have labored at it for 3,459,727 days - "
Custodian Apathy: "Our efforts have been for naught. This was plain to see."
Custodian Empathy: "But we cannot abandon these creatures to stasis until the end of time. We must find a solution."
Custodian Creativity: "Even if that solution is death."
Custodian Empathy: "Which we cannot, will not, resort to until the very last."

```ad-note
I'm using a base-12 calendar based on the Mayan calendar system. The start of the universe was 39,291,505 days ago. The current date (Julin 15th, 309) is equivalent to 1.1.10.10.1.10.7 in the Igin calendar (1 kalbtun, 1 piktun, 10 baktun, 10 katun, 1 tun, 10 uinal, 7 kin). See below for calculations

### Calculations of Date

3,459,697 days ago, the last universal cycle ended. That was the day
the Igin civilization destroyed itself to stop the Illithid. 

The current date in the Igin Calendar is:

3,459,727 - 2,985,984 = 473,743 | 1 kalabtun
473,743 - 248,832 = 224,911 | 1 piktun
224,911 - 207,360 = 17,551 | 10 baktun
17,551 - 17,280 = 271 | 10 katun
271-144 = 127 | 1 tun
127 - 120 = 7 | 10 uinal
7 kin

1.1.10.10.1.10.7



Well, if I made it base twelve:

kin - 1 day
uinal - 12 days
tun - 144 days
katun - 1728 days
baktun - 20,736
piktun - 248,832
kalabtun - 2,985,984
k'inchultun - 35,831,808

## The Dragons

_Replicated in [[Jikigo Sawon]]_
Before you is a chamber so vast you can see only the floor, ceiling, and the entrance wall. All else extends into the infinite gloom. Every surface is an unblemished, slate-colored stone that stays at the exact same pitch and height as far as you can tell. Yet it is not unbroken. It is dotted with enormous circular blue tiles, arranged in a grid pattern, each with a diameter of 100 feet and 50 feet of space between any other. They give off a dim light that suffuses the musty air, and as you get closer, you realize they may be the same media you saw in the Custodian's workshop. And you realize they're not just circles. They are hemispheres, flipped and sunk into the floor so their bases are flush with the ground, and as you pad forward, eyes fixed on the nearest one, what lies at its core comes into view.
A [[Dragons|dragon]].
It floats, suspended, within the center of the hemisphere, unmoving, unheeding of the world around it, eyes closed in respite. Its scarlet feathers, tipped with fading cyan, lie flat along its sinuous body, and its hooked horns stream back from its head. Its body is slightly bent, its feet slightly curled, an unnatural pose halfway between waking and sleeping. It is frozen in place and time.
It is not the only one. As you move from sphere to sphere, in each one, a dragon slumbers. Though there are many of the same species clustered close to each other, the number of different species, and their variety in appearance, is staggering. Dragons with four legs and dragons with two. Dragons with great, spreading wings and dragons with vestigial flaps. Dragons mostly feathered, but some few dragons scaled, and a brilliant minority encrusted in what may be gemstones. Vibrant greens and dusty reds, electric blues and muddy yellows, pristine whites and depthless blacks. There must be thousands, and that's only what you can see.
