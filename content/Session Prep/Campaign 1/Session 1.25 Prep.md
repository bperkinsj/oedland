# Traveling to Echetmol

The party made it to the oasis after 80 kilometers. I said Echetmol is about 380 km away. Another 300 kilometers to go.

On the night of the 27th/morning of 28th they'll come across the valley of souls (scene 1). On the night of the 28th/morning of 29th Eli Wallach will catch up to them and make his proposition. More valley of souls throughout the night. 
On the night of the 29th/morning of 30th the Erinyes will infiltrate. (day 6)
On the night of the 30th/morning of the 1st a group of 3 speeders will come after the group. 



# 3 Possible Scenes 

## Scene 1 - Caravan & Valley of Souls
The caravan comes across patches of the Valley of Souls bleeding into their world. 

````ad-read-aloud
The ground ahead of you changes. It is as dark as the ash that falls from the sky, but where before it had been a sooty patchwork laid across the sand, now it is a carpet covering all. And it _glitters_. Glistening flecks sparkle in uncountable number across it, giving the impression of a night sky bedecked with stars.

Whoever is on the forward right and left scouting positions can see it curving away, so it is small enough to navigate around without too much difficulty. Regardless of how they cross it, they come upon more of these patches of the Valley for the next few hours.

Later that night, as dawn is breaking and they are bedding down, [[Ysobel]] hears her sister [[Emilly Waler| Emilly]] calling to her. She begs Ysobel to follow her for she does "not want to go alone."

## Scene 2 - Eli Wallach

Eli comes to make a proposition to Blondie (and the rest of the party). 

"All the men I've worked for before, they're just puffed-up cocks strutting around the coop like they mean something. But ol' Mephy... he's the real deal. He's the fox outside the coop, and he's just waiting to break in. "
