## Verdorben

Verdorben is plunged into chaos due to the decapitation of the heads of state and of the slave rebellion. 

## Greater Oedland Area
Pockets of slave rebels will rise up throughout the countryside, in some areas successfully, leading to a patchwork of Emprenacht and slave-owned territories. The territory will become a true free-for-all.

## Economic Fallout
Loss of most of the slaves is a severe shock to the Oedland economy, leading to a deep depression. Many people will attempt to flee back to the Emprenacht. Even if the government manages to regain control of the capitol, the economic damage will be done.


## New Leaders

[[SÃ©tanta]] leads the [[Devoted of Saint Ardbert]].


[[Adelaide Yancey]] heads the [[Republic of Oedland]], a group of plantation and farm owners looking to retain their property.
