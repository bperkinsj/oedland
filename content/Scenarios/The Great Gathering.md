To those who have a thousand and no forms.

#### Ceremonies
Many ceremonies and dances. It becomes clear to the players after a while that no discussion is going to take place on this first day. The Serech are supposed to lead the last ceremony, but instead they hold a vigil. They begin a steady [drum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRTCH25VASA) beat and let it go for hours.

## Possible Routes for the Party

- The party head the war council for the tribes, plan the military strategy, and assist the tribes in battles

	- Complication: they must delve into the ruins of the illithid empire in order to retrieve a cure.
		- The dragons were infected with a virus. They will need some sort of treatment that targets this virus. The illithids would have developed such a treatment in the event that there was a crossover event from dragons to other species.
- The party search out the artifacts of the gods
	- Complication: they will need several people powerful enough to use them
	- The Boshkonyi may know where the [[Heart of Gol]] is.
