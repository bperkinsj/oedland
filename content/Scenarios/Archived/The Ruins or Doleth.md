The party is faced with a decision: Do they head south to plunder the Illithid ruins in search of a cure for the dragon pox, or do they head north and confront Doleth?

[[Chaleha Sadevarra]] returns to inform the players of the location of the [[Illithid Ruins]] ([[Session 1.36 Prep]]). 
- A contingent of the [[Avarian Army]] will arrive at the ruins in 8 days.

At the same time, a scout returns with news that Bien is dead by the hands of [[Doleth Ewalago]].
- There have been no signs of a black box around Bien or any of the gods that his fellow scouts have been to.
- It is uncertain how long it will take for Doleth to arrive at each god.

#### Native Leader Reactions
[[Hejawakanoh|Clever Sora]] will demand Doleth be tracked down and dealt with. 
[[Dehan√§wis]] will agree with Clever Sora
[[Niswe ono Mhulu]] will argue in favor of heading south, saying that there is little the gods can do to help them at that point.

[[Blondie]] (according to Alex) will essentially agree with Niswe but defers to Dawn's judgement.
