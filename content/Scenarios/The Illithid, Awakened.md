- 309/07/30: The [[Avarian Army]] arrives at the [[Illithid Ruins]].
- 309/08/01: A scouting party discovers a preservation chamber containing an Illithid and awaken it. They are then taken over by the Illithid. 

A contingent of the Avarian Army, led by Colonel [[Ivan DÃ¡vila de Ciotega]], arrive and begin to examine the ruins.

The Avarians re-awaken one or two Illithid, but they would likely be quite delirious after thousands of years in stasis. The party will probably come across them, weak and nearly powerless.
But it doesn't mean that there isn't another Avarian contingent that hasn't also been infected...
