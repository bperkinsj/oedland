# Valley of Souls
The Valley of Souls is an alternate dimension that exists alongside the mortal world.

## Travel within the Valley of Souls
The Valley of Souls does not map directly onto the real world, but instead is constantly in flux.
- _However_, a rule of thumb is that one mile in the Valley of Souls is equivalent to 14 miles in the mortal realm.
