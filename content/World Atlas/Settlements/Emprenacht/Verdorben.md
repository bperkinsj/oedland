## Shops and Establishments

Magical clothing:
- Silk and Sorcery, run by an Anadi, Anu Ndiche (Cameroonian name). Modeled off of Gilbert from Critical Role. Will be very deferential towards Dawn. Has spellhearts for sale in his private sanctum. 

Wands and Staves
- Wright's Wands and Staves, run by a ratfolk, Thaddeus Wright. Very much like Ollivander. Thinks  of staff-making as an art. Sources his wood mainly from the swamp lands and jungles to the north, from species such as [i]Dalbergia lutum[/i], [i]Alnus sericeus[/i], and [i]Tilia occidentis[/i]. Premium stuff, up to level 15.

Armor and Weapons
- Hard Iron, run by a hobgoblin, Dirk Bahr. He speaks very rarely, usually in a monosyllabic manner. Up to level 10.
- Bastion's Blades, run by a large human man, Lutz Mannheimer. Very gregarious, strong German accent (can I pull that off?). Magical weapons of all levels. 

Missives, Spell Catalysts, a few scrolls, talismans
- A Miraculous Thing, run by a very chipper gnome by the name of Susie Whitford. While she can only carry divine scrolls and a few arcane scrolls, she knows where to point the players to find a black market seller of scrolls (go to a flower shop named Prairie Rose and ask for Nightshade). Instructions are to go around the corner and down the stairs into the basement.

Black market scrolls
- Julienne Dubose (goes by Nightshade).

Alchemical concoctions and Potions
- Potent Putrefaction, run by a human woman who looks like a mix of Yzma and Trelawney, Gerda Beckenbauer. Like an odorous and unpleasant Trelawney. Has a twin sister, Merda. Gerda wants customers, Merda doesn't.

Hunting Supplies
- The Lion's Share, run by Dead Rib, a female gnoll. 

Magic Musical Item shop (mainly sells codas):
- Sublime Symphonies, run by an elven woman 

Magical Gun Shop (has holsters, firing mechanisms, and regular guns)
