# Jikigo Sawon

The Jikigo Sawon is the vault erected by the [[Igin Communion]] to keep the [[Dragons|dragons]] safe in their preserved stasis while the [[Custodian]] searched for a cure to the [[Draconic plague]]. The Igin created an organic entity named [[Mother]] to guard the vault, but over the years, Mother (and the Custodian) went insane and partitioned themselves into multiple personalities in order to continue functioning. Mother divided into [[Mother Life]] and [[Mother Death]], who then began to war with each other over who was the true guardian of the vault. Custodian divided into a perhaps-unknown number of personalities centered around emotions. The most common to surface are Custodian Logic, Custodian Empathy, Custodian Creativity, Custodian Apathy, and Custodian Frustration. Custodian Fury would surface more frequently but is kept in check by the other personalities.

### Front Entrance
```ad-read-aloud
Embedded within the slick, damp back wall of this cave is a circular doorway. Petrified, ashen wood inscribed with delicate filigree depicts a female elf, eyes closed in gentle repose and the world held tenderly in her embrace. Around her spiral vines and flowers, twisting amongst each other into waves of cords that thicken and thin, a surface that curls and loosens in waves.
...

As the door crumbles before you, shafts of light break into the room beyond, illuminating pieces of a grisly scene.
```

Passphrase to open the entrance:
"igos-eul jikineun ulideul-eun ttaega wassdago malhane" (We who guard this place say the time has come)
### Entry Area
Within are piles of bodies, speared through, torn apart, or crushed into fine bits. There are multitudes of creatures here: figures that appear to have been carved of wood, deformed creatures of flesh with heads that split apart into a gaping maw, a being whose skin and internal organs are almost entirely translucent. 

### The Custodian's Workshop
Here the [[Custodian]] carries out its work to find a cure for the dragons.
The hieroglyphics on the door are a medical creed.

_This read-aloud is for campaign 1, when Dragaroo Fodder is ushered inside to save Flint._
You step into a large room suffused with bioluminescent lighting. Near the entrance is what you take to be an intricate wooden statue, possibly carved or grown of entertwining vines, topped by a sable sphere. That is, until it begins to speak to you.
Custodian Empathy: "Quickly now, we cannot waste a moment."
Like a cobra weaving to a flautist's tune, it undulates across the floor alongside you, sprouting twig-bundle arms as it guides you towards an enormous vat grown from the ground that is filled with a luminescent blue liquid. It directs you to place Flint within it, and so you lower Flint inside, the liquid feeling cool and viscous against your arms, more gel than fluid. As soon as you withdraw your hands, the creature is bent over the tub, its movements hurried as it feeds what must be vines and roots into the gel, from which you see small bubbles percolate as gases mix and something is injected into the media.
Custodian Logic: "I cannot afford any attention for now. Please be patient."
You step back and look around, noting the many copies of this vat (each one large enough to house an elephant or two), the rows of disc-shaped alcoves in the walls that are filled with the same sort of media, the root system that blankets every wall, carpets the entire floor, and dangles from the ceiling. The room is circular, with a dais in the center upon which perch several trees, and a large circular doorway across from the entrance. As you approach the dais, you can see that the trees are shorn of their foliage, and perforated lines of the same bluish media striate the branches and trunk.

### The Stasis Chambers
Here sleep the [[Dragons|dragons]] until the day they can be saved from their gruesome fate. 

```ad-read-aloud
_Replicated in [[Session 31 Prep]]_
Before you is a chamber so vast you can see only the floor, ceiling, and the entrance wall. All else extends into the infinite gloom. Every surface is an unblemished, slate-colored stone that stays at the exact same pitch and height as far as you can tell. Yet it is not unbroken. It is dotted with enormous circular blue tiles, arranged in a grid pattern, each with a diameter of 100 feet and 50 feet of space between any other. They give off a dim light that suffuses the musty air, and as you get closer, you realize they may be the same media you saw in the Custodian's workshop. And you realize they're not just circles. They are hemispheres, flipped and sunk into the floor so their bases are flush with the ground, and as you pad forward, eyes fixed on the nearest one, what lies at its core comes into view.
A dragon.
It floats, suspended, within the center of the hemisphere, unmoving, unheeding of the world around it, eyes closed in respite. Its scarlet feathers, tipped with fading cyan, lie flat along its sinuous body, and its hooked horns stream back from its head. Its body is slightly bent, its feet slightly curled, an unnatural pose halfway between waking and sleeping. It is frozen in place and time.
It is not the only one. As you move from sphere to sphere, in each one, a dragon slumbers. Though there are many of the same species clustered close to each other, the number of different species, and their variety in appearance, is staggering. Dragons with four legs and dragons with two. Dragons with great, spreading wings and dragons with vestigial flaps. Dragons mostly feathered, but some few dragons scaled, and a brilliant minority encrusted in what may be gemstones. Vibrant greens and dusty reds, electric blues and muddy yellows, pristine whites and depthless blacks. There must be thousands, and that's only what you can see.

## Mother
Mother Life and Death differ in personality, which is most apparent in their aesthetic values. Mother Life prefers verdant, flowering vegetation and creatures that are angelic or fey-like in appearance. Mother Death prefers mushrooms and decomposing organic matter and creatures made of flesh with twisted or incongruous appearances.
