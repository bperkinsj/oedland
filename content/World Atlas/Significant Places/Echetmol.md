# Echetmol

Echetmol (possibly translated as "Altar of the Gods" in [[Serech]]) is a grand butte of igneous rock rising out of the land roughly 40 kilometers south of the southern tip of the White-Fang mountains. It is where the gods revealed their artifacts to the tribes, showed them the process of creating beast thunderers, and taught Serech how to forge sky-thunderers (TODO possibly to be redacted).
