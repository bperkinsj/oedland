Use Avaria as an analogue for current-day AI? I mean, it's obvious, but whatever. It's still a good combination.
Avarians use magic casually and ostentatiously, in a way that is very shocking to people from the Emprenacht. People in the Emprenacht use some magical items, such as magical plows or amulets, but rarely venture out of these defined boundaries. Servants of the God-Emperor are the only ones for whom magic use is considered acceptable. Even though there are institutions to study the magical arts within the Emprenacht, such as the Academi, they are shunned by others, underfunded, and disregarded. This has led to a glacial crawl in the rate of scientific, magical discovery.
