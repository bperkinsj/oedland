## Old World God of the Sea

The sailors of the Old World still show great reverence to the old god of the sea, a great serpent by the name of [[Nathair]]. Every voyage begins with an offering of fish, meat, or drink thrown overboard when the ship has pulled out of port. Despite attempts by Emprenacht authorities at repressing this and other rituals, many sailors still carry it out surreptitiously, often dumping the offering out of a gun hatch.

### A Sailor's Account
_The logbook of Arthur Sinead
18th Jos, 286 HER (His Emperor's Reign)

_Today is the first day the first mate, now Captain, has let us off pumping duty since the storm. No easy task, what with 20 of the men lost_. (As this man describes, his captain, a flagrantly abusive and ostentatious man, can be seen yelling obscenities at his crew members and threatening them with a whip. A lightning strike hits a nearby wave, illuminating the silhouette of a great serpent and an enormous yellow eye peering down upon them. Moments later, the wave hits them, sweeping the captain and over a dozen men overboard.)
