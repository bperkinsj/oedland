It started? Okay I think it started. Alright so I want to think about the proper way for my players to receive information within the world. How does Pathfinder allow for information to be sent? It uses a bunch of magical items, some missives and letters and such, but it doesn't really this is actually really hard. So how does this complement the whatever you call it, the western history sort of thing? Well it works this way, how do I think this fast, maybe I should look aaay from my keyboard. It's actually way more difficult than I thought to write like this. I put a lot of crap onto the page.
Anyways
The ability to observe distant things is very, very limited. I see _clairvoyance_ and [_scrying_](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=268), but those spells are not at all that powerful. _Clairvoyance_ in particular is limited to 500 feet. The Peridot crystal ball allows for telepathy with the target, but that's a level 17 item.

The [ivory baton](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1492) may be used by the [[Reino de Avaria]]. 

Cube of Recall, 19th level item, lets you instantly travel to up to four designated locations.

[Slates of Distant Letters](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=744), 25 words per hour, level 13, ~2.4k gold.

[Stone of encouragement](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2467) could be funny.

How would a [Folding Boat](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1370) impact the world? It's only 500 gold.

[Furnace of Endings](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2552) is an interesting way to transmit secret messages.

[Anchor of Aquatic Exploration](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2186) is an interesting item for exploring the world.

[Wraithweave patch](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1724) another item for storing more things?
A lot of items in Pathfinder seem to be about minimizing storage space or summoning creatures.
Then there are talismans, which are basically boosts to saves or skills. So in that way, people would definitely carry around their own talismans, although they probably wouldn't actually work.
Also a bunch of alchemical foods, but like, at their price point they're probably wildly out of the budget of any normal person???? Like, delver's scales are 155 gp. A "comfortable" lifestyle is roughly 52 gp per year. I think it's fair to equate one gold piece to about $1,000, so one silver is $100 and one copper is $10. That makes a delver's scales _$155,000_. Jesus.
So in the Pathfinder universe, magical items are basically out of the reach of ordinary people, unless they're inherited, and then even a simple Talisman would be held on to dearly. 

> [!question]
What is going on here? 

So what we're looking at is a world where magical items and usage is out of the hands of everyday people. Practically only the top 10% of society has _any_ regular access to it.

Okay, but if we look at vehicles, the Steam Cart is about 120 gp. Those would be fairly common. 
Fireflies are expensive at 450 gp, but damn if that isn't a cool concept.
Idk how practically useful the Clockwork Wagon is. 1 hour of wind-up per 8 hours travel time. I suppose that's actually not that bad.

Okay, so interestingly enough, the prices for the regular vehicles are actually reasonable. A sailing ship, for instance, is 2k gold, which is about 40 times the wage of a "comfortable" lifestyle. A common Dutch flute would have been about 10,000 guilder, roughly 20 times the wage of a bureaucrat, who made 500 guilder per year. So, not terribly unreasonable. But that does really push a lot of these items out of the hands of the common folk. 

### Missives
Missives are more what I'm looking for
[Messenger missive](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2064) has a max range of 360 miles, which isn't terrible, but they are susceptible to be intercepted.
If the explosive missive exists, nobody would open mail? They're not cheap, per se, but they're 13 gold, which is pretty nice, and 4d6 damage would kill most commoners. Red-handed missives ostensibly solve the problem of someone going through your mail, but wouldn't most people just use messenger missives anyway?
