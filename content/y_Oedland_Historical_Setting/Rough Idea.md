First city-state in the world. The King (or similar) has been killed and now several families are warring for power.
The main character is special because they can pass between the mortal and spirit realms. They will find further on in the story that they can draw upon power in the spirit world to deify them.
Main plot of the game is gathering allies from amongst the five major families/tribes (not decided yet).
Like Magic the Gathering, there's a green (jungle) faction, a brown (mountain) faction, a blue (sea/lake/river) faction, a yellow (desert) faction, and a red (badlands) faction.
There are also five gods who you can curry favor from. In order to speak to the gods, the player must travel into the spirit realms corresponding to those five factions (though each faction doesn't necessarily follow that god).
Each god also embodies a different type of government.
There's the crocodile god (blue, embodiment of anarchy), the camel god (yellow, embodiment of oligarchy), the ant god (green, embodiment of democracy (?)), the lion god (red, embodiment of monarchy), and a last god that I haven't decided on (possibly an eagle? Would embody theocracy? Ooooh, or even better, aristocracy).
In addition, the player character is guided by another god in the guise of a helpful spirit. This god would either be some animal that can change appearance (something more menacing than a chameleon, though - possibly a praying mantis or snake?) or he would be a god of shadow. This god will try to trick the player into giving him power. The player will have to fight him, but if the god successfully tricks him, the god will be much more powerful.
Lastly, the player can take a route where they do not align themselves with any god, but instead attempt to deify themselves and rule how they see fit. They will be much weaker in the penultimate part of the game, but in the final battle they can choose to draw upon that power, giving them a huge buff. Alternatively, they can decline to draw upon that power as a challenge. 

Magic works on a system of ley lines. Veins of power that run through the world. In a turn-based combat system, those lines of power are drawn throughout the grid. The main character is one of the few people that can see the ley lines and can actually change them. Some sort of limited power to move, shape, or break lines. Their power can be represented by their veins glowing different colors. There are also different types of ley lines - water, fire, earth, or something similar.
Other people can access those ley lines by using tattoos, and there are some especially gifted users who can draw and store the power of the lines for later use.
Breaking ley lines can have negative consequences on the surrounding area, leading to corruption. Throughout the game, players can also help to heal broken ley lines to restore certain areas.

What if, instead of leveling up, your character instead had to "master" each ability they learned before they could get a new one? They would complete objectives based on the skill. And for the soft skills, they could also gradually get better as they use the skill, like they have to first learn to persuade people in low-stakes situations, and as they get better, they become more and more persuasive. That gets rid of the whole quandary of stats and ability scores. Of course, you'd probably need some sort of exclusivity system or currency to keep people from getting everything.
