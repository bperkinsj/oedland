## Bangs
- [[Doleth Ewalago|Doleth]] arrives at [[Heshi]]'s location. 
	- The party can attempt to talk him down. Doleth will make the case that the gods are already gone, they can no longer help the natives, and it would be a kindness to put them down and a cruelty to let them endure.
	- Use [Metuak](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=1833) for Doleth's stats. [[Nesset]] will summon four [[Invidiak]]s to assist.
- The Avarian contingent begins to attempt to revitalize the Illithid. Is it possible for the threat to spread beyond this? ([[The Illithid, Awakened]])

## Background Events
- 309/07/25: The western arm of the [[Devil Army]] arrives at [[Echetmol]] and destroys it (see [[Session 1.34 Prep#The Ruin of Echetmol|The Ruin of Echetmol]])
- 309/07/30: Doleth arrives at Heshi's location, where the party is waiting for him. ([[Doleth Slays the Formless Ones]])
- 309/07/30: A contingent of the [[Avarian Army]] led by [[Ivan DÃ¡vila de Ciotega]] will arrive at the [[Illithid Ruins]].
- 309/07/32: One of the Avarian delvers will discover a preserved set of mindflayer tadpoles. He will bring it back, in the process accidentally infecting Ivan, most of the senior officers, and several of the rank and file troops. 

## Scenario Updates
- 309/07/30: Doleth arrives at Heshi's location, where the party is waiting for him. ([[Doleth Slays the Formless Ones]]) (Previously he would have slain Heshi).
