# Nail File Dagger
## Item 10

---
==unique== ==magical== ==relic==
**Usage** held in 1 hand **Bulk** 0.1
**Aspects** celestial and emotional

---
This dagger was blessed by Glashnok upon Amandalynn's pronouncement of his divine benevolence before the tribes of Rechaa. Delicate stars of golden filigree bedeck the hilt, in sharp relief with the darkly violet, gently curved blade.

The dagger gives a bonus to Diplomacy checks as determined by Emotion Surge's Joy power.
