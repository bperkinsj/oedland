The Cloak of Starlight was woven for Last Light of the Moon Before Dawn by the goddess Boshet to aid her in the fight against the Second Devil Invasion. It is a lightweight, hooded cloak whose black fabric seems to shine with thousands of twinkling stars.

The cloak allows you to cast the _[ghost sound](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=132)_ cantrip as an arcane innate spell. When you adjust the cloakâ€™s clasp (an Interact action), the cloak transforms to match the environment around you and muffles your sounds, granting you a +1 item bonus to Stealth checks. In addition, you gain resistance 5 to fire damage (Heaven's Grace).

**Activate** `[two-actions]` Interact; **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You draw the hood up and gain the effects of [_invisibility_](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=164), with the spell's normal duration or until you pull the hood back down, whichever comes first.

The heavens protect you from harm. While wearing the relic, you gain a +1 status bonus to AC against attacks by [fiends](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=70) and resistance to an energy type corresponding to the relic's celestial origin (such as sonic resistance from a [choral](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=14) angel). The resistance is equal to half the relic's level (minimum 1).
