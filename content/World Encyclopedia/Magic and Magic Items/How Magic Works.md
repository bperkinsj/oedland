# The Source
Magical energy evolves alongside the increase in complexity in systems (in some ways, it is similar to a hypothesis concerning consciousness). Thus, the planet as a whole and all things that live on it are a source of magic, as is the sun and other complex systems. This has implications for how greater power might be sought after (they can try to funnel all of the power of the sun) and how magic could be turned against someone (they could have the magic sucked out of them. Maybe those are undead?).

## How it's channeled
Magic is incredibly unwieldy and potentially deadly to those who attempt to use it without structuring it. For most of history, people have done so by calling upon the "Gods", great beings that walk the world. By invoking magic in their image, users are able to refine and focus it to achieve their intended effect. Recent advances have uncovered mathematical formulae that allow users to shape magic without invoking the Gods.
