A (non-exhaustive) list of artifacts given to the players by Degory Aigar. 

## Common Artifacts
These artifacts were mentioned by at least three separate and unrelated cultural groups, indicating either strong cross-cultural spread or a common historical narrative.


### Seed of Osiris
"As the water poured over her hands and trickled onto the earth, she saw green buds sprout and shoot upwards, and trees with once-wilted leaves grow green and supple, and animals began to dance beneath the boughs."

### Heart of Gol 
"To them was given his Heart, which beat and shook the land with the force of his passion, and with the Heart, they rent the mountain asunder, and the devils spilled into the depths of the earth."

### Blood of Yong
"'My blood runs through you, my child. It is the fire that burns in your veins,' he said as the blue flames danced above his hand. 'They would take from you what is mine to give. This I cannot allow.' And so saying, the flames turned to ice, and all around them the devils were frozen, but the people were spared."

### Eye of Sai 
"They looked down as if from a grand height, the field stretching out before them. They could see where the devils milled, their eagerness for bloodshed evident as they paced and jeered. Across from them was the full strength of the tribes. Their great leaders were at the fore - Alḵway, Mseleku, Sere, Chamrouen - and they stood proudly so as to bring heart to their followers. When the battle started, they could see every part of it and could inform their warriors of such, so when the devils attempted to surround them or draw them in a trap, they were always forewarned. Though many were lost that day, this view from a bird's eye gave them the advantage and they drove the devils back."

## Other artifacts 
These artifacts are mentioned only by one or two tribes and indicate some historical legacy unique to that tribe or tribes.

### X̱ált'wem (kalt-woom, with the k like an "ach" in German)
"...in his hand, X̱ált'wem/
the spear of Alḵway burned as the sun..."

### Ushujaa
Apparently a cloak or mantle.

"... though the devil's weapon blazed, Mseleku knew no fear, for Ushujaa could never burn..."

### C̀ak'e (chah-k-e)
"The arrow that Kala-Ṡa loosed from C̀ak'e pierced the heavens. Down came thundering a flood that washed away to the river below all in its path."

### Rumi 
"The blade of his axe was magically carved to show every foe it had ever felled."

### Msaada 
"Odo-Ndiche's staff was more than a simple length of wood. With it, he could hurl a dart thrice the length a great warrior could throw a spear."

### Preah
"...Isthul danced through her foes, Preah felling them left and right, and the devils fled from its touch which turned their skin to ash."
