# Cultural Liaison
An individual charged principally with determining how a foreign culture can be integrated into the Emprenacht. This person may be of that culture or may have extensively studied it. In furtherance of their goal, they are required to understand the intricacies of said culture, what aspects of it are aligned or opposed to the practices of the Shtegaltic Church, and what can be safely left whole when the culture is integrated and what is desirable to be expunged.
