# Shtegaltism

The Church of Shtegaltism is the largest Davinian church in the world, with 50 million members. It was founded in 1196 V.A. and was considered a minor Davinian branch until the [[Council of Wings]] in 9 V.A., numbering only 600,000 members at its peak.
## Origin

## Structure

### God-Emperor
The [[God-Emperor (Deity)]] is the head of the Shtegaltic church.

### Inquisitors
The church deploys a large number of agents with near-limitless discretion and freedom. The only figures they answer to within the Church are the God-Emperor and the [[Nine Angels]].
