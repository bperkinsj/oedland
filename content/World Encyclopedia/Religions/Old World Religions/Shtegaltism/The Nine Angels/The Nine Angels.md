# The Nine Angels

The Nine Angels are the [[Angel|angels]] that appeared at the [[Council of Wings]] in response to the summons of [[God-Emperor Friedrich I]]. They serve directly under the [[God-Emperor]] as his heralds and enforcers. The work of the angels is given top priority in the Church and any adherents or citizens of the Emprenacht who find themselves called upon by the Nine are obligated to assist them, often without explanation or recompense.
