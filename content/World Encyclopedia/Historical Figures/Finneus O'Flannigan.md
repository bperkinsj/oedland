# Finneus O'Flanagan

Finneus O'Flannigan was a historian of the [[Kyrie Emprenacht]]. Born in 212 [[FD]], he is most known for his expansive work [[The Dialogues of Finneus O'Flannigan]] (often abbreviated as The Dialogues), which detail the history of the Kyrie Emprenacht through a reconstruction of the preceeding nations, historical events, and ideologies that ultimately gave rise to the Emprenacht, as well as a history of the Emprenacht up to his time. Although it anchors the course of history to the Emprenacht, his methods of analysis of primary sources and his categorical approach to the reconstruction of history proved highly influental on proceeding scholars.
