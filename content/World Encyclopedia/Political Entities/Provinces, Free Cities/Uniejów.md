Uniejów (with a capital of the same name), a province that had been poor for much of its hundred years of history but over the past two centuries had enjoyed an uptick in fortune. With it being situated at a perfect intersection for the import of raw industrial materials such as coal, iron and cotton and the export of crafted materials, a factory industry sprung up that quickly brought it wealth and attracted minds with a bent towards industrial experimentation and technological innovation. It was its expertise in industry that made it such a lucrative target for the Emprenacht as well as a foe uniquely fitted to fight that same empire, with a range of military innovations powered by a strong individual identity. While the insurgencies ultimately failed, the dream of a free and strong Uniejów united in industry and science still lingers in the hearts of many republicans. Its bent towards free thinking and experimentation means that it shares much in common with the Kingdom of Avaria, and many republicans escaped into that same nation. It is also purported to be the birthplace of clockwork inventions, which now are a major force behind the military strength of Avaria.
