# Igin Communion

An ancient civilization that was highly proficient in the use of primal magic. Brutalized by a war with the Illithid Empire, who had enthralled many Igini, their most powerful druids decided that their only hope was to sacrifice their civilization to defeat the Illithids. The thirteen of them gathered together and, using the four artifacts ([[The Heart of Gol]], [[The Eye of Sai]], [[The Blood of Yong]], and [[The Seed of Osiris]]), channeled their power into multiple cataclysms that devastated the Illithids and the Igin while also shattering the thirteens' consciousnesses into various swarms and hive-minds. 
## Political Organization
The Igin Communion was headed by the [[High Circle]], a group of the most powerful druids of their civilization.
