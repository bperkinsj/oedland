# Pirates

## History
The pirates are largely composed of people who fled the Emprenacht, both citizens of now-subdued states or dissidents of the Emprenacht. After initial tense relations between the pirates and the natives, an agreement was reached whereby the pirates were allowed to establish several settlements upon native land (TODO: which tribe(s)?). Since then, relations have been very cordial, with much trade of ideas and goods between the peoples, and the pirates view themselves as in the debt of the natives. They have even incorporated much of the culture of the natives for their own, taking their knowledge of seafaring, shipbuilding, and survival, adopting and adapting it in novel ways.
