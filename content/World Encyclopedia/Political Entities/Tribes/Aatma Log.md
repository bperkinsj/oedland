# Aatma Log

The tribe inhabiting the island south of [[Rechaa]], [[Angae Ttang]]. They speak [[Gimneu]] (their holy language) and [[Raatmabhara]] (their main language). 

## Background

So let's say that children spend the first 8 years on the island, growing up, learning how to help the community, and being taught their practices
Then, on their 8th birthday, they are taken into the [[Valley of Souls]] for the first time and introduced to the spirits therein
They spend their next 8 years learning more about their heritage, learning how to interact and communicate with the spirits, and also specializing into some role within the tribe
Perhaps the most sacred role is that of the [[Raajanayik]], a mediator between both the Aatma Log and the spirits, and within the spirit community. The spirits value the Raajanayik's role as a third-party mediator between spirits very highly, but it is also a complex position to be in given the rather idiosyncratic ways in which the spirits relate to each other
Those Aatma Log who don't have a dedicated role within the Valley of Souls spend no more than a few months of the eight years before adulthood (8-16) within there, but still make regular visits as part of typical trade between the spirits and Aatma Log
