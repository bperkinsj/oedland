## Geographic Location
The Pisi Rumikuna are a tribe that dwell in the southwest foothills of the [[White-Fang Mountains]] (which they call the Harkana, or "barrier"). They have adopted a pastoral, nomadic lifestyle that is characterized by their migration to the lower vales of the mountains in the summer and then their descent back into the foothills in the winter. They wear long skirts in the summer and flowing robes padded with furs in the winter, with wool garments underneath.
