A tribe dwelling in the [[White-Fang Mountains]], the northern mountain range. Known to other tribes as the People Who Live Amongst the Heavens.
## Geographic Location
The Boshkonyi primarily reside within the great canyon known as the [[L'amku]] (yahm-koo) formed by the [[Ish River]]. 


## Culture
### Religion
The Boshkonyi religion revolves around the concept of the Great River. The Ish river runs through two lands: the mortal world and the [[Valley of Souls]]. In the mortal world, it brings the source of life (e√±ua) from the Valley of Souls and takes away the departed; in the Valley of Souls, the spirits leave and the river is rejuvenated with the source of life. In the day, the presence of the Ish is constantly felt as its roar carries through the canyon and mist rises from below, but night is the only time one can see its path in the Valley of Souls, marked by the speckled pattern of spirits high above.
