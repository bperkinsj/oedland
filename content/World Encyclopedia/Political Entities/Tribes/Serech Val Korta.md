The desert in the heart of [[Akto]] is inhospitable at its periphery and, by the standards of any seasoned traveler, uninhabitable at its core. Nevertheless, the land is occupied. The Serech are an enduring and duty-bound tribe who have persisted in the heart of the desert since ancient times. Despite their isolation, they are well-known by tribes throughout Oedland, and held in high esteem.

# Geography and Terrain


The Serech are semi-nomadic, with travel routes that encompass hundreds of square kilometers of Oedland’s great desert. Most of the territory that the Serech occupy is arid, interspersed with weathered monoliths and rocky plateaus. At the heart of the desert, and visible on the horizon for days preceding one’s actual arrival, is Kuzorik - the dormant volcano where the Serech tribe make permanent residency. To the Serech, it is a constant backdrop of their home, a sight to be revered and monitored. To a traveler who first lays eyes on it, Kuzorik is staggering.

On most days, the sky is clear and the vertiginous peak of Kuzorik stretches endlessly towards the heavens. When the winds blow from the west, the structure of Kuzorik is so monstrous that whatever fractional humidity has survived the journey from the sea cannot pass over the crest of the volcano. Clouds obscure the summit of the volcano, and the rain that falls on Kuzorik’s western side becomes the only source of water for miles. The precipitation never gives rise to any vegetation on the barren slopes. According to the Serech, this is because the mountainside still remembers the cursed footprints of a devil army from centuries past. The water flows in a thin stream, picking up ash and charcoal as it runs until it gathers in a pitch-black pool at the base of the volcano. Drinking directly from the pool causes illness, but the water permeates into the surrounding land sufficiently that ground wells can be dug in a perimeter some distance out.

# Culture
## Food and Cuisine
### Agriculture

Despite the inhospitable nature of the land, the Serech have managed to cultivate a small strip of arable land around the western edge of the volcano’s base. With the support of water from the wells, they grow low-moisture crops such as wheat and mustard greens. The wheat berries are coarsely ground and eaten as a dense flatbread, forming a staple component of the Serech diet. The roots of both cultivars are preserved and added to stews. Most of the tribe, including the young, the elderly, and a slight majority of the women, live permanently in the volcano’s shadow and ensure the survival of the crops.

The other main demographic within the Serech tribe are the semi-nomadic lizard-herders. This group travels throughout the desert, following the tribe’s stock of [[Nektala]]: lizards that resemble giant geckos, domesticated for their meat and hides. Away from the wells and crops at Kuzorik’s base, dehydration, sunburn during the day, and hypothermia at night present real and immediate risks. The tribe relies on the Nektala to guide the way through the desert, and will hunt and eat the same swarms of monstrous insects that the lizards pursue. 

The preservation, and transformation, of crops and meat represent the final pillar of Serech agriculture. Over the centuries, a unique fermentation process has been developed that transforms natural resources into various mutagens. For plant roots and stems, they are boiled and mashed into a firm ball, which is dried in the desert sun for several days. Nektala meat is thinly sliced, then dried until it resembles a jerky, and finally shredded into thin fibers before being compressed into a dense puck. The roots and meats are finally coated with a mixture of ash and sand, and buried several feet below the ground for varying amounts of time. The longer they remain buried, the more potent the resulting mutagen.

## Trade
Throughout the year, small contingencies will travel from the [[Nektala]] herds back to the [[Kuzorik]] encampment. Meat and hides are exchanged for stocks of preserved roots, fresh mustard greens, and bags of wheat.

On a larger scale, the Serech have essential trade partnerships with neighbouring tribes to the north. While the tribe strives to be as self-sufficient as possible, this is an impossible goal in the great desert. Nektala-hides are traded for wool, cloth, and steel from the mountain tribes. To an outsider, the nature of the trade agreement may seem unbalanced. Nektala hides are not a high-quality good; the leather is easily scuffed and is prone to cracking after a few years. In comparison, the wool threads and thick cloaks that they receive in return are some of the finest in the continent, able to insulate against the cold desert nights while providing shade from the heat of the sun. There is more nuance to the trade agreements than just the quality of the raw goods, and the partnerships are based on a centuries-old understanding that the Serech must always have access to the materials that they need to survive. They fulfill their trade obligations by standing guard at Kuzorik’s base, and if fine-spun wool and steel blades make that a more bearable process, it is a fair trade.

## Customs
### The Ashukor

In addition to the Nektala-herders and the farmers, the other main demographic within the Serech is the Ashukor - the unit of elite warriors. Martial proficiency is a cornerstone of Serech culture, and all able-bodied members of the tribe train daily. While every Serech knows how to wield a spear and throw a dagger, the abilities of the Ashukor are unmatched. They are the elite of the elite, and are responsible for training all other members of the tribe. The title of ‘Ashuk’ is laced with prestige and duty, and the trials required to earn it are grueling. 

Ashukor candidates, Ashuk-sin, are identified by elders when they are young. They are often the children of former Ashukor, but this is not a requirement. From childhood until they come of age, their are partnered with an Ashuk mentor. Their mentor is responsible for teaching the Ashuk-sin everything they need to know to survive the final coming-of-age ceremony that will initiate them into the elite warrior unit. In addition to the obvious physical training (progressing from rattan to live steel as they get older), the Ashuk-sin also study pedagogy and military strategy, enabling them to effectively pass their skills on to the rest of the tribe and future Ashok-sin. 

When the Ashuk-sin, their mentor, and the Serech elders collectively agree that they are sufficiently-prepared, the Ashuk-sin completes the final stage of their training: a solo journey to the summit of Kuzorik. 

The journey performs multiple functions, testing both the physical and mental fortitude of the Ashuk-sin, as well as serving as a scouting mission to ensure that the volcano remains dormant. From departure to return, the journey typically takes no less than 40 days, but can take longer than 60 in the face of adverse weather conditions. Physical challenges include lack of food and water, harsh winds and frigid temperatures. The journey also tests the minds of the Ashuk-sin, as high altitude and nutritional deficits lead to confusion as they near the summit, and the path is still littered with the preserved bodies of Serech who fell short of the summit. It is not uncommon for Ashuk-sin to report seeing shadows moving through the rocks at the peripheries of their vision, even if they fail to identify any concrete evidence of a demonic return. As proof that they successfully reached the summit and looked into the crater of the volcano, a rock from the crater’s edge is brought back. 

While much rarer, the summit journey is not restricted to the Ashukor. To return from a journey to the top of Kuzorik is the highest honor in the Serech tribe, and the journey may be attempted by any individual as a way to prove their capabilities - either as a way to make amends for past misdeeds, or in preparation for special tasks or unique missions. In these cases, a companion may be selected from the Ashukor ranks, but all parties, and the Serech elders, must agree to the journey. 

## Language
_See main article: [[Serech]]_

The structure of the Serech language is interesting. While it is grammatically straightforward, with simple and consistent modifiers added to indicate tense and possession, the working vocabulary is immense. Multiple Serech words have the same definition when translated to other languages, but differ extensively in their connotation. As an example, there are well over a dozen words for water, including korshen (the purified water from the ground wells), korshnir (water that induces sickness, such as that found in the black pool at the base of Kuzorik), korshaa (a large body of water), and additional words for rainwater, water from rivers, water that has been poured onto crops, and waters with different flavour profiles attributed to different mineral concentrations.

### Names
Names are an important part of Serech culture. Although they are usually not given until the child nears their first birthday, they are something to be treasured once they have been received. A good name, by Serech standards, is one that invokes an emotional response. Serech names are poetic, often alluding to a specific concept, feeling, or idea.

Might come back and flesh this out more later, but it’s just gonna be a placeholder for now.

#### Sun Festival
Needs to be fleshed out, but this is a once-a-year festival that falls near the summer solstice (the height of the celebrations happens on the solstice, but the festivities continue for a few days before and after). All of the Nektala herders return home to re-unite with family, and tribes from the mountains also travel to Kuzorik to engage in trade and celebrations. Celebrations include: 

- Mutagens are unearthed and consumed
- Large fires that burn through the night
- Songs and dancing and contests of strength (often challenges made against the Ashukor, who usually win)
- Many families reveal the names of the children that were born that year
