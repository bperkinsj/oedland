# Msitu

Heron Patiently Waiting is daughter of the chieftainess of the tribe.

The Msitu are a tribe that dwell at the northern end of the Baridi River. They dwell in spacious underground dens and use their magic to make the ceilings translucent, allowing them to see above the ground. This gives the appearance of trees floating suspended in the air. The den is dug so that the walls are reinforced by tree roots.

A Shifter dwells with the tribe. His name is Eye Above All (Rohoya Mwewe in the tribe) and he can take the form of a hawk. As he finds the usual quarters of the Msitu claustrophobic, he stays in a cave much higher up the cliffside.
