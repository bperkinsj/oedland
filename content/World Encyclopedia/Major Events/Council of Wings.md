# The Council of Wings

The Council of Wings is a major Divinian religious event that is considered the precipitating event for the ascension of the [[Church of Shtegaltism]] and the creation of the [[Kyrie Emprenacht]]. The 9 angels appeared in the presence of [[God-Emperor Friedrich I]]]  and the ecclesiastical [[Court of Fathers]] and pledged their allegiance to the Church of Shtegaltism and Friedrich.
