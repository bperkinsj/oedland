[p]Besides the typical PF2e categories of Common, Uncommon, and Rare, Oedland has two additional categories: Very Rare and Disallowed. Very Rare ancestries represent ancestries that have 1 or 2 extant members or have never been known to live amongst other mortal creatures. Disallowed ancestries are not allowed under any circumstances, as they are inconsistent with the theme, the setting, or some other aspect of the campaign. As usual, you are required to consult with the GM if you are considering a Rare or Very Rare ancestry. [/p]
