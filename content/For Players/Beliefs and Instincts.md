# Beliefs and Instincts
As part of the new [[Hero Point Homebrew|Hero Points]] system, players must now come up with three Beliefs and three Instincts for their characters. These Beliefs and Instincts inform how their character behaves, how they view the world, and what goals they wish to achieve.
_Most of this is taken from [the Burning Wheel](https://www.burningwheel.com/). 

## Beliefs
In essence, Beliefs are the top priorities for the character in play.

These are not general beliefs, like "God" or "Country". These are explicitly stated drives that tie directly into the world and setting. Examples of Beliefs are "I must redeem myself in the eyes of the Emprenacht clergy" or "I will protect my friend's sister at any cost."

When sculpting your character's Beliefs, think: What do I want out of this character and this situation? How can my character's Beliefs reflect that? Then shape your character's Beliefs to reflect those priorities.

### Anchored Beliefs
Beliefs are not arbitrarily chosen. You relate each one to what is going on in the game. They bind your character into the world. As they are challenged, they give you the chance to express what your character is about.

### Beliefs in Play
By openly and honestly setting down your priorities, you help the GM and the other players get the most out of the game. Now that they all know what you're after, they can help you get it .

Stating a Belief for a peasant, "I'm the true king of this land," does not make it factual in game. But by getting that out in the open, you are letting other players know you want situations revolving around that theme - a mad peasant rebel rising to challenge the established order. Other players are in on both the irony and drama , and they can help you get the most of them. You might not succeed, but playing out that struggle is what the game is all about. Of course, this doesn't mean the characters are aware of each other's Beliefs. We're talking about a strict
separation of player and character here.

### Changing Beliefs
A player may change his character's Beliefs as he sees fit. Characters are meant to grow and change through play. Changing Beliefs is a vital part of that growth. However, the GM has final say over when a Belief may be changed. If he feels t e player is changing a Belief to wriggle out of a difficult situation and not as part of character growth, then he may delay the change until a time that he sees as appropriate.

## Instincts
Instincts are also player priorities for a character, but they have a different mechanical application than Beliefs. Rather than reflect who or what the character is, Instincts help define how the character acts. What's been drilled into the character's head? What life lessons has he been forced to learn? What has he taught himself in order to survive?

### Always, Never, When, or If/Then
The best Instincts are defined as clear statements - either "Always do X," or "Never do Y," or as " If this condition arises, then take this action." What an Instinct does is set a condition and a reaction to that condition for the character. And this reaction/behavior of the character is sacrosanct: So long as the conditions are met, the action is done. The player doesn't even have to announce it. It either happens behind the scenes or instantly, without hesitation.

_A common Instinct is something like "when on patrol, always have my bow
ready and an arrow nocked. "Even if the player never states this, so long as
it's written on the character sheet, it is fact._

Instincts allow players to set conditions for their characters that might otherwise break the rules. Do you have a "draw sword" Instinct? Well then, your character 's sword is drawn at the start of combat without having to spend actions. Instincts cannot allow you to bypass a test, but they can ensure you made the test at some time before trouble started.

### Changing Instincts
A player may change his character's Instincts as he sees fit- as the character's experience in play changes him. 

_Rich's insurrectionist watched his friend's mind get warped and twisted by a foul wizard until he was nothing more than a drooling thrall. As soon as the scene ended, Rich turned to the GM: "I'm changing one of my Instincts. I'm losing "Always scrounge for weapons after a battle" and changing it to "If I am ensorcelled by a wizard, I plunge my sword into my throat and kill myself." Quite a brutal Instinct, but it was something he felt very passionately about._

However, the GM has final say over when an Instinct may be changed. If he feels the player is changing an Instinct not as part of character growth, then he may delay the change until a time that he sees as appropriate.
