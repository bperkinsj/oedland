# Hero Point Homebrew System

Although Pathfinder 2e is a wonderful combat system, it has very little mechanical support or incentive for roleplay. As a way to reward players for faithfully roleplaying their characters and making decisions that (positively) complicate the narrative, I have devised a system that alters the Hero Points of the base game to be akin to the Artha system in [the Burning Wheel](https://www.burningwheel.com/) (many rules of which I have lifted unchanged). 

## The Basics
First, Hero Points are now directly related to a character's [[Beliefs and Instincts]]. It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with these rules before you continue, but in short, your character now has Beliefs that inform how they view the world and what they want to achieve, and Instincts that describe some default ways in which the character behaves and acts. Beliefs and Instincts are, in essence, guide posts for your character that also give the DM criteria by which Hero Points can be awarded. 

Hero Points work as described in Pathfinder 2e, with these changes:
- Players do not automatically receive Hero Points at the start of sessions.
- Players are no longer capped at 3 Hero Points.
- Players do not lose their Hero Points at the end of the session. They persist through the campaign until spent by the player.
- There are now different types of Hero Points, consisting of:
	- Fate points
	- Persona points
	- Deed points
	These can be spent in different ways.

## Using Hero Points
Hero Points can be used in the same ways as the base system:
- **Spend 1 Hero Point to reroll a check**. You must use the second result. This is a fortune effect (which means you can't use more than 1 Hero Point on a check).
- **Spend 2 or your last Hero Point(s) to avoid death**. You can do this when your dying condition would increase. You lose the dying condition entirely and stabilize with 0 Hit Points. You don't gain the wounded condition or increase its value from losing the dying condition in this way, but if you already had that condition, you don't lose it or decrease its value.
- **Spend 1 Hero Point to use an ability from a Hero Deck card**. This rule only applies if using the Hero Deck.

All types of Hero Points can be used in this way. However, each type of Hero Point also comes with specific uses:

### Fate
#### _Exploding Dice_
A player may spend a fate point to make the dice of a single damage roll or healing roll "exploding dice" - in other words, if the max value of a dice is rolled, that dice is rolled again. This can chain! I.e., if you roll the max value on an exploding dice, roll it again. However, if used on a critical hit, the exploding dice are not doubled - they are added after doubling the "base" damage of the attack. Damage dice of size d4 are exempt from this rule. Exploding dice are purchased before the dice have been rolled.

#### _Shrug It Off_
Faced with a devastating attack or destructive force, a player may choose to spend a Fate point to endure. They gain resistance equal to their level to the damage taken. This resistance stacks with any resistances the character already has. This is purchased after the damage dice have been rolled.

#### _Up My Sleeve_
A Fate point may be spent to restore 1d4 spell slots if you are out of spell slots.

### Persona
#### _Boon_
A player may spend a Persona point to increase their degree of success on a skill check or saving throw by one step. This point is spent after the result of the roll is revealed.

#### _Bane_
A player may spend a Persona point to force an enemy to decrease their degree of success on a skill check or saving throw by one step. This point is spent after the result of the roll is revealed.

### Deed
#### _Dumb Luck_
A player may spend a Deed point to add an element to the narrative that benefits them in some manner. The edge of a cliff that the villain is standing on is near to breaking. The messenger boy who is vital to delivering the military orders is an exceptionally gifted horse rider. You know a banker, a family friend, who may just be willing to bankroll your expedition. These elements do not outright win the scenario for you - the villain may notice how unsteady the cliff is the moment before you break it, or the messenger boy is intercepted by a fortuitously timed patrol -  but they may prove to be a decisive part of your victory. 

## Earning Hero Points
Given that players no longer automatically earn Hero Points automatically, the ways in which they can be earned have been expanded. The three types of Hero Points - Fate, Persona, and Deed - are earned in different ways. In addition, Hero Points are not handed out exclusively by DM fiat. Players can nominate each other for Hero Points, and if enough people agree, then the point is awarded.

### Fate Points
Fate points are earned by playing to a character's Beliefs, Instincts, and characteristics, or with humor. 

#### _Beliefs_
Fate points are earned for manifesting the character's Beliefs in a convincing and entertaining manner. A point is given when playing a Belief serves a purpose and drives the game forward.

_Andy's crime lord, Omi-yori, has the Belief, "It is always better to smooth wrinkles than ruffle feathers." At the table, Pete and Ian are having a row between their characters. Andy interposes his character and, making conciliatory gestures to both parties, diffuses the situation. Andy will earn a Fate point for that Belief._

#### _Instincts_
Fate points are earned for playing Instincts when such play gets the character in trouble or creates difficult or awkward situations.

_A character with the Instinct "Draw my sword at the first sign of trouble" is at court pleading her case. Suddenly, in walks her nemesis! The player doesn't have to draw her sword. She can resist the Instinct because it's going to cause trouble. But if she plays it out, she gets a Fate point._

#### _Humor_
A Fate point is earned if a player can stop the table dead with humor while in character. Dramatic play gets even greater rewards (see Embodiment and Moldbreaker below).

#### _I Know Just the Thing_
Lastly, if a character uses one of their skills in an ingenious way, has just the right bauble or trinket for the situation, or knows exactly what to say, they earn a Fate point. These can also be earned if the character is able to leverage some aspect of themselves - their ancestry or background - in a way that drives the story forward.

### Persona points
Persona points are earned by idiomatic roleplaying, breaking out of the mold of destiny and by accomplishing personal goals. 
#### _Embodiment_
When a player captures the mood of the table perfectly and further drives the story onward, one Persona point is awarded. Moments like great speeches, desperate decisions or gruesome revenge fall into this category.

#### _Moldbreaker_
If a player comes to a point in the story where her Beliefs, Instincts, and traits conflict with a decision she must make - a direction in which she must go - and she plays out the inner turmoil in a believable and engaging manner, then she earns a persona point. 

#### _Personal Goals_
Characters who accomplish personal goals - revenge, promotion, seduction, victory, etc - earn a Persona point. These goals should either be clearly described in a character's Beliefs, or should be an explicitly stated goal for the group. 

### Deed Points
Deed points mark a character's accomplishments beyond his immediate and personal goals - going beyond what is desired to what is needed. To qualify for this reward you must do something that benefits more than just your character, and do it for reasons other than personal gain. Such an accomplishment must come with some cost or sacrifice - it's got to hurt a little to attain this level. Exacting revenge on your enemies through a brilliant plan is great, but it's only worth a persona point. Hitching yourself to a cause that transforms the setting - but doesn't directly benefit you or your friends - is worth a deeds point. Also, helping another character accomplish goals that are anathema to your goals, Instincts and Beliefs can earn a deeds point.
