[p]Born and raised in the rugged frontier of Oedland, you spent your early life working as a farm hand or rancher. You may have found this sedentary lifestyle too restricting, or perhaps you saw potential in the vast herds of Longhorns that roam the plains of Oedland. You may have even been one of the hands hired by Joseph McCoy in the very first cattle drive in the summer of 307. Whatever the reason, you now know the ins and outs of the cowboy lifestyle: how to drive, cut out, and brand cattle; what to pack out and what to leave behind; how to watch for signs of disaster, be it storm, stress, or stampede. Of course, in a place like Oedland, the environment is not only the danger, and so you're probably proficient with a six-shooter or rifle to ward away errant ruffians or the occasional drake.[/p]
