Notification of change of Will by Fitz Waler:
I, Fitz Waler, certify of being sound of mind and under no duress as I change my will. The following changes have been notarized by Kassel notary Emeth Seth.

  

In case of my demise, my council vote and the ranch are to go to my first daughter: Emilly Waler, married Holsteiner, as is the ranch account. The family account is to be transferred to my wife Ambrose Waler, if her passing would have preceded mine, the account balance is to be split between my daughters Emilly and Ysobel Waler, based on their family sizes. 

Should my daughters be parentless, and Ysobel still unmarried, a small fund has been created to give her a monthly allowance, the account is under the care of the Kassel bank.

News article sharing the new ownership of the Pack Creek ranch, previously known as the Waler Ranch, that was devastated in a fire four months ago. The article mentions that the ranch was sold as is with its assets, 2 studs and 15 mares.

The new owner asked for his name to stay out of the publication.

The seller, James Holsteiner acting on the behalf of his wife Emilly Waler is quoted saying: “I am happy to move forward, the fire was a disaster that weighed heavily on our family but we can now try to rebuild our lives. I know that the ranch is in good hands and the new owner has promised to rehire the hands should construction be completed”.

As of the date of publication, none of the hands have been contacted and no construction has been started.

Returned to sender, addressed to Ysobel Waler at the Kassel inn.

Please sister,

I beg of you to stop this insanity and to come to Verboden with James, mother and I. Your rooms are ready and I even found a nice home for Acorn down the street where you will still be able to visit him daily. The family that owns the stable is looking for a hand, and knowing your skills I have given them my word and they have agreed to take you as an apprentice for a gold piece a week. I know we had our differences but I really think you would come to enjoy the city if you gave it a chance. 

I can no longer tolerate your silent treatment and know that I have asked James to stop your allowance, maybe if the comforting thought of your family is not enough, maybe hunger will drive you back home.

[[Emilly Waler]].
