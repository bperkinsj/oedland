From [[Session 1.8]]:
Amandalynn is maybe not as intelligent as Cornelius (and I) thought. Neera plays her on the very edge of obliviousness. Cornelius may get rid of her after a time. But, most of all, she reminds him of his daughter (appearance-wise). He sees "her ghost in your features".

From [[Session 1.13]]:

Demon took Celia?

They request an anti-possession device. Possessed Amandalynn? Get something from her. She gained an understanding of its spirit and general predisposition. Something of little relevance. Give them a blank cheque. How do they use it?

She really dislikes the [[Sprout|Cactus]].

She asks how I came to know of her. She has the capacity to learn but has much to improve on.
