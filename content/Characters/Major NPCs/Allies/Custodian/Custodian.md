# Motives



# Goal
Find a cure for the virus afflicting the dragons. 


# Background

The Custodian was created as an autonomous servant to find a cure for the virus ravaging the [[Dragons|dragon]] population. It was made by several members of the [[High Circle]]. The Custodian has a genius-level intellect and an incredible capacity for logical thinking, in some ways rivaling modern-day supercomputers, but its creators, who always worked from a blueprint of living creatures, imbued it with personality and emotion as well. In the intervening millennia since, the Custodian has been forced to fracture itself into multiple independent personalities who maintain a tenuous balance of power. The most common to surface are Custodian Logic, Custodian Empathy, Custodian Creativity, Custodian Apathy, and Custodian Frustration. Custodian Fury would surface more frequently but is kept in check by the other personalities.
