Inquisitor der okkulten, dämonischen und teuflischen Phänomene (Inquisitor of the occult, demonic, and devilish phenomena).

Inquisitor Lorath Nahr is a high-ranking individual within the [[Church of Shtegaltism]], located at the Grand Cathedral in [[Verdorben]]. He is one of the few Church officials concerned with understanding the nature of demonic and devilish beings and the like and spends many hours combing through curated and dilettante accounts in order to ascertain some unknown fact. He is furthermore a knowledgeable scholar on many disparate topics such as herbalism, history, alchemy, theology, astronomy, and more, and is a skilled alchemist and tinker. His work, considered devious and potentially heretical by many of his peers, is protected by his title of Inquisitor, and he answers only to the archbishops and above.
