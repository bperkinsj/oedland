# Niswe ono Mhulu
# Motives
Desires power and respect, and views displays of strength as the only true path for attaining them. His father, [[Dhoruba za Kuzaliwa]] (Breath Births Storms), was deeply respected by the [[Halamu]] and managed to forge a confederation of the Halamu tribes that dominated much of the northwestern area of the continent and exacted tribute from their neighbors. He earned the title Mkuu, or "Great One". Niswe feels he must not only meet, but surpass, his achievements.


# Goal
To become the greatest chieftain in the history of the people of [[Rechaa]].
