### Letter sent to [[Ysobel]]

Date -2 years  
Returned to sender, addressed to Ysobel Waler at the Kassel inn.


Please sister,

I beg of you to stop this insanity and to come to Verboden with James, mother and I. Your rooms are ready and I even found a nice home for Acorn down the street where you will still be able to visit him daily. The family that owns the stable is looking for a hand, and knowing your skills I have given them my word and they have agreed to take you as an apprentice for a gold piece a week. I know we had our differences but I really think you would come to enjoy the city if you gave it a chance.Â 

I can no longer tolerate your silent treatment and know that I have asked James to stop your allowance, maybe if the comforting thought of your family is not enough, maybe hunger will drive you back home.

Emilly.
