# Mother

# Description
The disembodied guardian of the [[Jikigo Sawon]], created by the [[Igin Communion]]. Mother went insane during her long vigil and partitioned herself into two personalities, [[#Mother Life]] and [[#Mother Death]], in order to continue functioning. She was made whole again when [[Dragaroo Fodder]] (the first campaign party) merged the two gems containing Mothers Life and Death and [[Dawn]] and [[Flint]] successfully guided the process of her healing. Now she continues her stewardship, waiting until the day the dragons can be freed and she may finally rest.
