# Sétanta

# Description

Although fatherly to the followers of Ardbert, Sétanta is dismissive of those who refuse to embrace the faith and downright cruel to loyal followers of the "False Emperor", the [[God-Emperor]]. It is likely he is a sociopath.

Setanta is a tall, slender, pale-skinned man of indeterminate age. Upon his bald head sits a circlet with a symbol of a shield at the fore, and electric-blue, manic eyes look out from a juvenile face. 
# Motives
Lacking true empathy, Sétanta has constructed an internal morality based around punishing those who harm others.
He believes truly in his moral vision and would end his own life if he thought he had vanquished all sinners.
# Goal
As a prophet of [[Ardbert of the Valiant Shield]], and leader of the [[Devoted of Saint Ardbert]], Sétanta wishes to bring liberation to the slaves of Oedland. He aims to expunge the remnants of the Emprenacht from the land - by any means necessary.
