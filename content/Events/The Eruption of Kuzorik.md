_Copied from [[Session 1.23 Prep]]._


To speak to Boshet, players must cross a chasm. Baem tells Dawn she must have faith and that "only in the dark can stars shine (or the path be seen)".

_Accompany with [Your Mother Is Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DFR41LS5A0), starting on the first instance of the word "flower"_

--------

A scene blossoms before you like a flower of onyx and ruby. Kuzorik has bloomed, and now its petals of red and black - lava flows against volcanic stone - unfurl from a churning crimson center. Thick smog wafts into the air like a cloud of pumiceous seeds scattered to the winds. They are mixed by updrafts and contorted by heat waves to blanket the view, until around you is as obscured as if you were peering through a dark cotton sheet. The sound carries to you as well - the grind of stone against stone, the deafening hiccups of scalding lava encountering pockets of moisture, the rumble of gases escaping the volcano's throat. It is a crusted scar that has cracked open and bleeds once more.

You peer desperately through the smoke, looking for a sign of something familiar. You search for the lines of crops studiously nurtured to retain moisture, the wells where water was drawn from deep within the earth. You search for the hollows amongst rocks where people dwelt at the peak of day. You search for the lines your young feet wore into the base of the volcano and the path you took to its summit. But there is nothing. Where once your tribe made its home, at the foot of this monstrosity, there is nothing left. Nothing but a layer of ash.
The vision shifts and you see a dozen people wandering across what was once a sea of bright sand, and is now a sea of darkened ash. They hold their cloaks tight to their faces and their hands across their eyes. Their mouths are covered in dampened cloth. Spears and bows dangle from their backs. A hunting party, caught unawares by the eruption and now stranded in the thickening gloom, searching for anything familiar, anybody they can find. At the back of their party, one of them screams and stumbles as a steel sword swings from the dust and hamstrings them. As they hit the ground, body contorting in shock, they are decapitated. In moments, the group is surrounded, and though they reach for their weapons and rally together, they are not prepared. Silvery weapons strike from all angles, on the ends of burnt-red, sinewy arms, and within seconds they are all dead. One of them reaches towards another in their last gasping breath, and their head is crushed beneath a calcified boot. Something is hunting them.

And then again, the vision moves, and you see a caravan of your people. The air is clear here, and the stars burn brilliantly above, but the desert is vitiligous, pockmarked by splotches of ash. Barely discernible, no more than dark smudges on the desert, several hundred people move in file alongside plodding lizards. What must amount to all of their worldly possessions are strung across the creatures' backs. They walk with their heads bowed and their shoulders bent. They walk as if they are beaten. They walk northwards.
